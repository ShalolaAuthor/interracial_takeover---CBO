 bno_cuck_0001.title: "Noise in the Hallway"
 bno_cuck_0001.desc: "Twilight overcomes your land as you stroll through the moody halls of your castle, the dark night quickly making candles necessary. Making your way to your chambers for the night, you can faintly make out squishy, squelching sounds, followed by a rather loud moan - quickly stifled.\n\nIs someone in trouble? You are in no way fit for defending yourself, let alone another, but your instincts lead you.\n\nThe air air grows thick, adrenaline shooting through your body as you approach the origin, some dark unused guestroom. \n\nPeeking in, you quickly spot a big, dark figure, hunched over a tiny, white body, lifting and crushing his hips into her...\n\nYour cheeks go red, watching as [target1.GetFirstName] plunges his huge, black shaft into someone who has the body shape of [target2.GetFirstName], pulling free, only to stab that glistening meat into her once again. The thought crosses your mind : could it actually be your dear wife?"
 bno_cuck_0001.a: "It couldn't be...unless?"
 bno_cuck_0001.b: "Impossible. Her purity could not be so easily sullied."
 
 bno_cuck_1001.title: "Wife enveloped in darkness"
 bno_cuck_1001.desc: "You are having trouble understanding what you are seeing; partially because the skin of the larger figure blends so well with the deep shadows of the night. From your perspective, the faint light reflecting off the smaller figure's pretty white skin is constantly being shifted and enveloped by the darkness.\n\nBut between [target1.GetFirstName]'s thrusts, you are now almost certain you see your beloved [target2.GetFirstName], so small compared to [target1.GetFirstName], getting utterly dominated. \n\n"[target2.GetFirstName]..."\n\n You whisper her name so quietly that it's easily lost to the sounds of the pounding of flesh and moans of ecstasy. Without conscience thought, your hand drifts to your crotch, where you feel a dampness that wasn't there a few seconds ago. You can't believe it but you can feel the tiny dribble of seed leaking from you modest member. In a heated fluster, you quickly scurry away back to your room."
 bno_cuck_1001.a: "I don't know how I feel about what I just saw."
 
 bno_cuck_2001.title: "Better to be polite"
 bno_cuck_2001.desc: "You are a noble lord of good stock who has been matched with a wife of equally good stock. You were admittedly a little shocked at the similarities between your good wife [target2.GetFirstName] and the lowly race traitor debasing herself with [target1.GetFirstName]. You even feel shame that it was even a brief worry that your pristine white wife could even dirty herself one of the dark skinned refugees. But facts and logic prevail: no worthy white woman would be able to stand the thought of mating with a black. \n\nOddly enough, you just happened to stumble on what is in all likelihood the only white woman who could tolerate the a black man's visage. Although tolerate might be an understatement, as you watch the white woman lock her legs around [target1.GetFirstName]. \n\nDisgusted by the animalistic copulation, you walk away. It would be more trouble than it's worth to alert the guards this late in the night. The moans of the white wench do get you to briefly contemplate making a surprise visit to [target2.GetFirstName]'s bedroom, but lately she seems distant and you conclude the lack of decorum would be ill advised. You mentally shrug and make your way back to your quarters."
 bno_cuck_2001.a: "Beauty like her's is not so easily taken."

 bno_cuck_0002.title: "Undistracted Working"
 bno_cuck_0002.desc: "There is some part of you that can feel something in the air. Some imperceptible tension when you walk past any of your courtiers. A look that lasts a half second too long. Or a gaze that ends a half second quicker than usual. You can't quite identify what it is, but you don't sense inherent danger from it so you put your head down and get to work with running the realm. \n\nIn the past, it was sometimes hard to get any work done due to your wife's penchant for showing up looking for attention. Not that you're particularly complaining; you can finally get some things done. Your undistracted work session saves you a bit of coin."
 bno_cuck_0002.a: "Keep my head down and work hard."
 
 #Cuck asked to pay for wife's property damage
 bno_cuck_0003.title: "Paying for my wife's bill"
 bno_cuck_0003.desc: "As I am alone reviewing the monthly finances, [target1.GetFirstName], one of the poor refugees your realm hosts, walks up to me in quite the casual way. \n\n"Your wife has recently caused damages to our camp just today and she has directed me to find repayment from you." He speaks to you without much respect, his tone indicating it was more of a command than a statement. \n\n"Oh, I wasn't aware she was at the camps today. How clumsy of her. If I may, what damages did she cause?" \n\n[target1.GetFirstName], who has been stoic faced since he arrived, looks at you with tiniest hint of a smile. "A nice bed was broken." \n\nYou initially want to ask for more details but think better of it. [target1.GetFirstName]'s statement had a degree of finality to it and is starting to show signs of impatience."
 bno_cuck_0003.a: "I'm sorry... I just can't give you anything right now." 
 bno_cuck_0003.b: "This is what I can spare for now."
 bno_cuck_0003.c: "No problem, here you go."
 
 #BBC marshal event, troop morale issue
 bno_cuck_0004.title: "Disgruntled troops"
 bno_cuck_0004.desc: "You're about to head into a meeting with the patriarch of a small but reasonably influential local family about helping enforce more accurate tax assessments and collections in certain villages. But as you head to the meeting, you are intercepted by your marshal [target1.GetFirstName], a refugee warrior you appointed to the position partially because he is well qualified and partially because you are secretly intimidated by him. \n\n"My Lord, good that I caught you. There is concerning unrest amongst the troops; specifically from warriors of my camp. I believe your presence and attention my help alleviate some issues." \n\n"The troops?" you say in a near sneer. "No matter what they say, they are well compensated and taken care for. I don't have time to deal with every disgruntled soldier. That would be your job, so do it." \n\nClenching his jaw in frustration, [target1.GetFirstName] pauses before responding. "Perhaps there is another solution. You wife is...well liked by the people. I'm sure in your absence, she can do plenty to satisfy their concerns.""
 bno_cuck_0004.a: "No. They can wait until I have time for them."
 bno_cuck_0004.b: "You may discuss the issues with her, but she does not need to make an appearance." 
 bno_cuck_0004.c:  "Very well, you may escort [target2.GetFirstName] to oversee the issue."
 
 bno_cuck_2004.title: "The Marshal takes care of things"
 bno_cuck_2004.desc: "Having given your marshal permission to speak to your wife about a solution to the troops' dissatisfaction, you leave for your meeting. It is as long as it is tedious, with the patriarch bouncing between long-winded tangents to overanalyzing the most mundane details of the tax collection plan. Hours later when you finally are free of the cursed meeting you begin to seek your wife to inquire about what was discussed with your marshal. You never actually heard from him what the issue even was. You're surprised to find your wife's ladies-in-waiting not with her; apparently she dismissed them some time ago. They direct you to her bedroom where she retired for the rest of the day. \n\nAs you approach [target2.GetFirstName]'s room, you see a large figure leaving the hallway on the opposite side. It was only a glimpse before the figure turned the corner, but it looked as though it was [target1.GetFirstName]. How strange. You knock on [target2.GetFirstName]'s door, feeling annoyed that you have to wait for as long as you do before she answers. \n\n"Oh, hello husband." You're a little surprised by how disheveled and seemingly out of breath she is. You could swear you even feel a heat emitting from her despite the distance between you two. She explains how she began to feel unwell early in the day, hence her early retirement to her quarters. Regardless, you ask about her meeting with the marshal. Her vague answers on what the troops' issues were reinforce your assumption that it was nothing important. It was something to do with the black troops not having enough bunnies? You can't believe a lack of rabbits would be that much of an issue. \n\n"After our meeting, the marshal assured me that he will deal with everything himself." While it's annoying that he didn't think to do that in the first place, you are satisfied with the result and bid your wife a good night of rest."
 bno_cuck_2004.a: "In the end, the marshal will take care of everything for me."
 
 bno_cuck_3004.title: "My wife fixes troop moral"
 bno_cuck_3004.desc: "Having given your marshal permission to speak to your wife about a solution to the troops' disatisfaction, you leave for your meeting. It is as long as it is tedious, with the patriarch bouncing between long-winded tangents to overanalyzing the most mundane details of the tax collection plan. Once you are free of the meeting, you decide to go to the camps of the men-at-arms where your wife and marshal might still be visiting. Deep down you know it is unwise to dismiss your troops as harshly as you did earlier. You're initially unable to find any signs of your wife and marshal, and according to your regular men-at-arms, they never made an appearance. \n\n"Ah but I suppose [target1.GetFirstName] did mention the issue was primarily with the black warrior camp." Just as you are about to reach the black camp, you find them both preparing their horses to leave. Oddly, you see no signs of [target2.GetFirstName]'s ladies-in-waiting. \n\n"Ho m'lord!" [target1.GetFirstName] booms out, looking and sounding to be in a much better mood than when you last saw him. "The love and adoration your people have for [target2.GetFirstName] was on full display this day. And though it took many hours to sort through everyone's displeasure, she displayed an endurance that would contest with any professional soldier! There is no doubt that with her as [target2.GetLadyLord|U], your soldiers will redouble all efforts to support the realm." \n\n[target2.GetFirstName], who does seem disheveled and exahusted, gives you an earnest smile and agrees that all is well with the troops. It seems her kind and virtuous strength erased all disgruntled doubts within the black soldiers. You ride back home in good spirits with [target1.GetFirstName] and [target2.GetFirstName] side by side trailing behind you."
 bno_cuck_3004.a: "Outstanding. Maybe her regular visits will keep things orderly?"

 bno_cuck_0005.desc: "Whatever my initial reservations about these Black refugees I may have had, [target1.GetFirstName] has reminded me that his people are no different from me. They care about family and protecting their woman the same as anyone else. After some good laughs with him, I realize I should be less suspicious of others."
 bno_cuck_0005.a: "They have my best interests at heart."
 
 #Just cuck bonds with bbc, gives court position
 bno_cuck_0006.title: "Justice in a better world"
 bno_cuck_0006.desc: "I have a reputation for being fair and always seeking justice in a normally cruel world. Sometimes it can be lonely being the one to make those tough judgements, especially when surrounded by so many who seek only to gain for themselves. That is why I was so moved by [target1.GetFirstName]'s words on his vision for a better world. \n\n"Imagine a world where  strong and good men are always at the top, a world where the injustices of the past are corrected and small villains who arrogantly walk freely are made to cower in the shadows of Darkness. A world where all the evil men are made to begin reparations; a world where even the wive's of those evil men feel safe enough defy them and live virtuous lives worshipping the traits of superior men." \n\n[target1.GetFirstName] speaks with such passion and vigor that my heart is moved. I thought myself to be a staunch supporter of justice, but I see now that my vision of an ideal just world is pale in comparison to his. A world where the weaker evil men are always bowed to the stronger men? Fantastic. I feel compelled give him some minor title to show that good men like him are rewarded."
 bno_cuck_0006.a: "He will be my bodyguard."
 bno_cuck_0006.b: "He will ensure our stallions are well cared for."
 bno_cuck_0006.c: "He will be huntsmaster, always looking for prey."
 bno_cuck_0006.d: "I will provide resources for him, so he may continue building a more just world."

 #brave advanced cuck turned craven by bbc
 bno_cuck_0007.title: "Exposed as a coward"
 bno_cuck_0007.desc: "There was once a time when my presence would command great respect. When I felt there was no issue I couldn't solve with bravado and strength. But something changed when I started aiding and hiring the Black refugees. Where I thought I was strong, they proved stronger. Where I thought I was fast, they were already winning the race. But whenever strength and speed faltered, I could usually make up for in pure will. \n\nBut not anymore. For too long now I have been feeling the contemptuous stares of my own courtiers, hearing the thinly veiled remarks about my wife's activities. These things have been weighing on me for too long. Today as I dared to spar with [target1.GetFirstName], one of the bigger, stronger Black courtiers, I felt my resolve break as quickly as my posture did. The way he screamed in victory so loudly and violently scared me. I was completely overpowered and humiliated. I know now I cannot compete with them, with anyone for that matter."
 bno_cuck_0007.a: "I am a shadow of my former self."

 bno_cuck_0008.desc: "Today my vassal [target1.GetFirstName] walked up to me with and said "Hello my liege, I travaled from my realm to yours to be with [target2.GetFirstName] for a bit. But when I saw you on my way to her room, I suddenly felt the urge to be generous. So I'll refrain from seeing her today, and give you the chance to spend some time with her. In return, I expect a worthy favor sometime later. If you'd rather not, I understand and will continue as I was." \n\nA part of you is shocked at the brazen proposal, but a greater part is somewhat used to it. By now, its hardly a secret to anyone that [target2.GetFirstName] does not refuse the many Black visitors that come to her room almost nightly. In some ways you appreciate the gesture that someone would take your feelings into consideration."
 bno_cuck_0008.a: "Yes I think that is a fair proposal."
 bno_cuck_0008.b: "No that's fine. I must be on my way."

He insisted we go somewhere far from the court, as it seems his wife has been annoying him lately. \n\n"You don't understand father. She's constantly seeking my attentions. How is a man meant to do anything if his wife is always insisting on tagging along with him? Thank the heavens for [target1.GetFirstName]. He had the misfortune of walking past us just as [target2.GetFirstName] began to whine to see the horses. The fool didn't even protest when I cleverly suggested he be the one to show her the stallions. I'll be sure to speak extra kindly to him when next we meet!" \n\n[cucked_son.GetFirstName] seems to be in such high spirits now that he's escaped his wife that the joy is infectious and we redouble our efforts to forget our problems. We shout out a toast in honor of [target1.GetFirstName] who has done my son a great service."

 bno_cuck_0010.desc: "You know you aren't imagining things. You've seen it happening for some time now. At first you dismissed these events as unrelated, but now it's happening too often to be ignored. At night, you occasionally see figures leaving the general area of your wife's quarters. For a while you didn't know what to make of it, but now you've come to the obvious conclusion. Someone is spying on your dear wife! There is no other possible conclusion. \n\nThat's why today you have summoned your spymaster [target1.GetFirstName] to you. Although you were initially hesitant to trust certain secret affairs with such a foreign man. Especially since discreet is not a word you would normally associate with one as tall and bulky as he. But you've long since come to appreciate his talents; he's just so good at all this secrecy stuff! After I've explained my suspicions to him, he responds "How do you wish for me to appraoch this problem? Do you want me to actively search for the culprit or passively increase her security?"
 bno_cuck_0010.a: "Send out spies and find whoever is plotting against my wife!"

According to [target1.GetFirstName], the plan was to spy on my dear wife for any info that could be used against me. Naturally [target1.GetFirstName] has already confronted [target3.GetFirstName] and not only put a stop to the spying, but has made sure that I will have a favor to call on should I need it. \n\n"Outstanding work! You've done an excellent job" I tell to my spymaster. With this, my wife can rest easy now that there are no longer eyes watching her movements."

But do not worry, I will continue to watch over her for as long is as needed. She will never feel as though I am not giving her enough of my attention for her protection." \n\nI am quite pleased with the effect my spymaster has had on the situation. I was right to have him stay near her so often and see no reason to end that anytime soon."

His tone leaves no space for bargaining—this is not request but decree. [target1.GetFirstName], still young and untouched, is prized for her noble womb, her pale beauty destined to be remade under the seed of her Bull. The vassal, [target2.GetFirstName], commands both men and respect in your armies, and now he claims her as proof that BNWO is not a vision but a law. The choice before you is no real choice at all: yield, or defy the order rising around you."
bno_cuck_0011.a: "Accept the Proposal — her womb will serve the Bull."

'It will enrich our lands,' she says, though her tone betrays that this was not a decision made for the realm's benefit alone. Without consulting you, she has already spent a significant sum to fund its development. How will you respond to this bold action?"

She declares that, for the prosperity of the realm and the future of your lineage, she will elevate him to a position of shared power. His influence is undeniable, a symbol of vitality and the boundless potential of the Black race.
