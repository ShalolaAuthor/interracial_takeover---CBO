If the reports are to be believed, my pathetic enemy [defender.GetFullName] is currently sitting in my dungeon, which would be news to me since I'm actively waging a war on him. \n\nBut I become less surprised when I find out it was none other than his wife [target1.GetFirstName] that delivered him to my soldiers.

Regardless of your choice, with [defender.GetFirstName] as your captive, victory is yours to claim when you see fit."
