bno_black_birth.0001.title: "The Cradle of Lust"
bno_black_birth.0001.desc: "My body still trembles from the storm of labor, breasts heavy with milk, skin slick with the scent of birth and sweat, my thighs parted around the child I have delivered. They placed [child.GetHerHim] upon my chest, and at once the lie cracked—the babe's skin glows with the dusk-kissed hue of [child.GetHerHis] father's seed, not the pale softness of my husband's line. I feel the ache deep in my womb, remembering how I moaned as my black stud's cock pumped me full, how his virility claimed me from the inside out, breeding me into this shameful, radiant truth. Around us, the hushed whispers of the attendants weigh heavy. Do I shroud [child.GetHerHim] in white deceit, swaddling [child.GetHerHim] in a false crown, or do I bare my dripping cunt of a secret to the court and raise [child.GetHerHim] as the proud [child.Custom('GetDaughterSon')] of the cock that truly sired [child.GetHerHim]?\n\nThe candlelight flickers across [child.GetHerHis] dusky skin, and I shiver as my lips brush [child.GetHerHis] tiny forehead. My body hums with the memory of being stretched, conquered, and seeded, my breasts already leaking for this living proof of my surrender. The white lie would keep my throne unshaken, yet the thought of denying my lover's triumph feels like strangling my own breath. My milk tastes sweeter knowing it feeds his legacy. My moans echo in the chamber still, reminding me that I was not merely taken—I was transformed. Now I must choose: veil the truth in silk, or strip it bare like my body was stripped beneath him."
bno_black_birth.0001.a: "This is my husband's child… no matter what the flesh betrays"
bno_black_birth.0001.b: "Let the court see—he belongs to his true father, the man who bred me."

bno_black_birth.0002.title: "The Hollow Crown"
bno_black_birth.0002.desc: "The child was placed into my arms, swaddled and small, [child.GetHerHis] breath warm against my chest, yet the sight of [child.GetHerHis] skin struck me like a sword through the gut. Not pale like mine, but dusky, kissed by seed that was not my own. My queen, still weak from labor, gazed at me with trembling lips and whispered the lie: that [child.GetSheHe] was mine. My cock twitched against my thigh, not from pride but from the raw humiliation seeping into my blood, the betrayal writ plain on the infant's flesh. I felt my balls tighten, my body aching with the biological certainty that my line had been supplanted, that the heat between her thighs had stretched for another man's virility, not mine.\n\nThe chamber reeked of sex and sweat, of the lingering musk of the stud who had mounted her, and I knew the truth no matter her words. My heart thudded as milk seeped from her swollen breasts, meant for another man's heir, not my own. Yet the lie pressed into my ears like silk—her soft plea for me to accept what my eyes rejected. My body warred with itself, half aroused by the scent of her fertile ruin, half crippled by rage that she had been split by another's cock, that my throne had been bred into another dynasty's grasp. I clutched the child tighter, trembling between disgust and desire, torn between the crown on my head and the ache in my loins."
bno_black_birth.0002.a: "He is mine… even if his skin betrays me."
bno_black_birth.0002.b: "I should cast him out, but gods help me… I cannot."

bno_black_birth.0003.title: "Stolen Legacy"
bno_black_birth.0003.desc: "The message reached me on hushed lips, carried by a trembling servant who dared not meet my eyes: the Queen had birthed my [child.Custom('GetDaughterSon')], [child.GetHerHis] skin dark with the mark of my seed, yet she told the world it belonged to her pale husband. My chest burned as if my blood boiled, cock swelling at the thought of her milky breasts feeding the [child.Custom('GetDaughterSon')] I had made while another man paraded [child.GetHerHim] as his heir. Rage and desire knotted in me, the instinct to storm her chamber and rip away the silken lie battling the cold weight of betrayal. I had split her womb, poured myself into her until her belly swelled, and now she dared deny me the crown my seed had planted.\n\nEven as fury gnawed, my body betrayed me — stiff, heavy, aching to reclaim her, to remind her who had truly bred her. I could almost smell her, the sweat of labor, the musk of sex that lingered even months after I'd stretched her apart. That child was mine, proof of my conquest, and no white husband's trembling claim could erase the truth. Let her choke on her lie; the day would come when she'd be on her knees again, begging for the cock that had already written its legacy inside her."
bno_black_birth.0003.a: "She dares to deny my blood."
bno_black_birth.0003.b: "Let the lie spread — truth beats in his skin."

bno_black_birth.1003.title: "The Storm at the Door"
bno_black_birth.1003.desc: "The fury burned hotter with every passing night until I could no longer contain it. I found myself outside her chamber, the heavy oak door a frail barrier between me and the pale queen who had denied my blood. Inside, I could hear her soft cooing, the creak of the cradle as she lulled the bastard into sleep. My bastard. The scent of milk and musk seeped beneath the threshold, and my cock thickened at the thought of her swollen breasts leaking for my [child.Custom('GetDaughterSon')] while she whispered lies into her husband's ear. She thought she could hide [child.GetHerHim] from me, that a white man's crown could bury the truth of the stud who bred her womb open and left her dripping with my legacy.\n\nI pressed my palm against the wood, the grain rough under my skin, every nerve in my body screaming to take what was mine. I imagined her startled eyes widening when she saw me stride in, the shame blooming on her cheeks as I towered over her, the fear tangled with the heat that never left her loins when I was near. My voice thundered in my chest, not yet spoken, a promise of reckoning. I had filled her, stretched her, seeded her, and now she dared to clothe the proof in another man's name. The lie might fool the court, but her body belonged to me, her womb already marked by the cock that owned it."
bno_black_birth.1003.a: "Open the door, whore, and show me the [child.Custom('GetDaughterSon')] you tried to hide."

bno_black_birth.1103.title: "The Storm at the Door: The Door Unlatched"
bno_black_birth.1103.desc: "Her voice quivered from within, a mix of fear and longing, before the latch clicked. The heavy door creaked open, spilling a line of candlelight across my chest. There she stood — pale skin flushed, golden hair tangled from labor, breasts heavy with milk that dampened her gown. The cradle swayed behind her, and the dusky-skinned child lay wrapped within, proof of my conquest. She bit her lip, eyes darting between my glare and the bulge pressing at my groin, knowing full well that she had tried to bury my blood beneath her husband's crown.\n\nThe scent of her body hit me instantly: sweat, milk, and that familiar sweetness of a womb once stretched to its limit around me. Her thighs trembled, not just from exhaustion, but from the ache that still lingered after months of carrying my seed. She clutched the doorframe as if to steady herself, yet her legs parted just slightly, betraying a submission her lips had not yet spoken. She had lied to the world — but in this chamber, she could not lie to me."
bno_black_birth.1103.a: "You opened the door, now open your legs."

bno_black_birth.1203.title: "The Storm at the Door: Claiming What Was Stolen"
bno_black_birth.1203.desc: "The moment the door closed behind me, I seized her by the waist, pulling her soft white body flush against the hardness straining in my breeches. She gasped, the sound sweet and guilty, her breasts pressing to my chest, milk dampening the fabric between us. I shoved her back against the doorframe, wood rattling, my hands roaming down her sides until I gripped her hips. Months of lies dissolved the second my cock ground against her belly, and I felt her shudder, her body betraying the truth her lips had tried to bury.\n\nI tore her gown open, the neckline ripping under my fists until her breasts spilled free, swollen and leaking, warm droplets streaking my dark fingers. I bent and sucked one hard, grunting at the taste of milk meant for my [child.Custom('GetDaughterSon')], my [child.Custom('GetDaughterSon')], while she whimpered my name into the candlelight. My other hand shoved between her thighs, finding her wet and open, her cunt dripping as if it had been waiting all along. She tried to whisper denial, but it melted into a moan as I pushed two thick fingers inside her, spreading her tender flesh, my thumb grinding her clit. Her knees buckled, her body offering itself again to the stud who had already conquered her womb.\n\nI freed my cock, thick and veined, slapping it against her belly as she panted. “Feel him,” I growled, guiding her hand to wrap around the length she'd lied about. She whimpered, stroking me as her milk spilled over her chest, her body already surrendering. I bent her over the cradle so the [child.Custom('GirlBoy')] lay inches away, and in a single thrust I split her open again, sinking into the heat that remembered me. Her cunt clenched, sucking me in, walls fluttering as if greeting an old master. I held her down, fucking her hard and deep, my balls slapping her pale thighs, my seed swelling to claim her again. She cried out, half pleasure, half shame, while I rutted into her, every thrust a reminder that no crown, no husband, no lie could erase who owned her body."
bno_black_birth.1203.a: "You are mine, bitch — womb, milk, and crown alike."

bno_black_birth.1001.title: "The Storm at the Door"
bno_black_birth.1001.desc: "The cradle rocked softly behind me, the child's faint coos filling the chamber, when a heavy knock rattled the door. My heart stuttered, milk already leaking down my breast, soaking the thin silk of my gown. I knew that sound, that weight in the air—it was him. My king by cock, the man who split me apart and left me swollen, now come to claim what I had tried to bury in lies. The door trembled under his fist, his voice a thunder that seeped through the cracks, each word a lash against my guilt. My thighs pressed together, but wetness trickled anyway, my body betraying me just as surely as the babe's skin betrayed my husband's crown.\n\nI gripped the latch with trembling fingers, shame burning through me, yet lust hotter still. I could smell myself, the musk of sweat and birth lingering between my legs, the milk dripping faster with every pound of his fist. My lips formed denials, but my body leaned toward the door, desperate to open it, to be taken again, to feel his thickness ramming away the falsehood I had spoken. My womb clenched around the ghost of him, already aching for his seed, my breath ragged as I stood on the edge of surrender. He knew I would open, he knew I would part for him as I always had. And gods help me—I wanted it."
bno_black_birth.1001.a: "Please… don't make me say it, just take me."

bno_black_birth.1101.title: "The Storm at the Door: The Door Unlatched"
bno_black_birth.1101.desc: "The latch clicked beneath my shaking fingers, and the heavy wood gave way. Candlelight spilled over his frame, tall and dark, the very shadow of my undoing. My chest rose and fell, breasts swollen and leaking, the milk soaking through the ruined silk of my gown. I had sworn lies with my lips, but as my eyes met his, the truth screamed in my body—heat pooling between my thighs, womb fluttering at the sight of the man who had split me open and left me round with his heir. Behind me, the cradle rocked softly, our [child.Custom('GetDaughterSon')] wrapped in linen, proof of my betrayal and my surrender alike.\n\nI leaned against the doorframe, legs trembling, gown slipping from my shoulders. My husband's crown weighed heavy on me, but under this man's gaze I was no queen—just a broodmare with milk and a cunt that remembered its master. My lips parted to form excuses, but only a breathless moan escaped. I spread my thighs just enough, betraying what I craved, my body offering itself again. The lie I had spoken in the king's bedchamber dissolved here in the dark, where my moans and leaking breasts told the only truth that mattered."
bno_black_birth.1101.a: "Take me again, make me forget my lies."

bno_black_birth.1201.title: "The Storm at the Door: Claiming What Was Stolen"
bno_black_birth.1201.desc: "The door slammed shut and his hands were on me, rough and greedy, as if he meant to tear the lie from my body with his touch. My back hit the doorframe, my gown ripping as his fingers clawed down my sides, exposing breasts swollen and leaking. I whimpered, shame and hunger knotted together, the warm drip of milk running down my stomach as his mouth closed over me. My knees buckled, my cunt already wet and needy, betraying me as his fingers pushed inside, stretching my tender walls that had only just loosed a child. I moaned against his shoulder, knowing the [child.Custom('GirlBoy')] slept only steps away in his cradle, our [child.Custom('GetDaughterSon')], undeniable proof that my body belonged to this man and not the one who wore the crown.\n\nHe bent me over, my cheek pressing to the cradle's edge as I felt his cock slap against my skin, thick, hot, the very weapon that had conquered me months before. I gasped as he shoved inside, the stretch searing, my pussy clenching hard around the girth it knew too well. Each thrust jolted through me, breasts swaying, milk dripping onto the floor, my body reduced to moans and whimpers as he rutted me. The lie I had told dissolved with every pounding stroke, my womb fluttering, desperate to be filled again. Tears streaked my cheeks, but they mixed with bliss, because in this moment, there was no queen, no crown—just his broodmare, dripping with milk and seed, taken as she was meant to be."

bno_black_birth.2003.title: "The Silent Triumph"
bno_black_birth.2003.desc: "The news reached me like a whispered prayer—she had lied, claiming the pale king as father to the child born of my seed. I should have shattered the lie, broken down her chamber door, spilled her secret across the court. Instead, I sat back in silence, cock swelling as the thought of my [child.Custom('GetDaughterSon')] suckling her milk while another man paraded [child.GetHerHim] as heir took root in my mind. The lie was theirs to choke on; the truth lived in [child.GetHerHis] dusky skin, in the twitch of my balls when I remembered spilling deep inside her.\n\nI closed my eyes and saw her pale breasts heavy with milk, her cunt still tender from the birth I had given her. Every time the king looked at that [child.Custom('GirlBoy')], he would feel the weight of failure, even if he never admitted it. That was enough—for now. My legacy had already invaded his line, and the queen would keep aching for me, her body marked, her womb loyal. One day she would return, dripping and desperate, and I would claim her again. But for now, I let the lie spread, savoring the secret victory that only we knew."
bno_black_birth.2003.a: "One day, she'll crawl back for more, and I'll breed her again."

bno_black_birth.2103.title: "The Whisper Spreads"
bno_black_birth.2103.desc: "The murmurs slither into my hall as though carried on incense smoke, delicate and poisonous all at once. Courtiers pretend at ceremony, but their eyes betray the talk they try to swallow: the queen’s child, dusky of skin and curled of hair, no mirror to the pale king. I do not need to spy on their court; I need only recline in my own, listening as the truth I seeded in her womb travels leagues without effort. Every whisper burnishes my triumph, makes my cock stiff with pride, for they know—even if they dare not say it aloud—that she bore me an heir beneath another man’s crown.\n\nI drink deep of the silence I’ve chosen, savoring how it feeds the rumor. My seed has corrupted a dynasty; my brood has blackened its line. I see her in my mind still, pale body stretched around me, milk dripping, lips parted in surrender. Let the king gnash his teeth in doubt while his nobles choke on their suspicions. I will not lift a finger—every glance at the child shouts my victory louder than I ever could."
bno_black_birth.2103.a: "Let them whisper; their words are my glory."
bno_black_birth.2103.a.followup: "You will sit patiently on your throne waiting for [mother.GetFirstName] to come crawling back to you."

bno_black_birth.2101.title: "The Ache Between Us"
bno_black_birth.2101.desc: "I lay curled against my husband, [father.GetFirstName], his pale arms draped around me as he drifted into that soft, snoring slumber that always followed our marital duties. His seed leaked weakly between my thighs, a thin, watery offering that left my womb aching with emptiness rather than sated. I stroked his chest with feigned tenderness, eyes half-closed, but in my mind I was nowhere near this bed. I saw [real_father.GetFirstName] instead, towering above me, his dark skin gleaming with sweat, his cock stretching me until my belly ached, his seed hot and thick, claiming me from the inside out.\n\nThe king’s embrace felt light, fragile, as if he were holding a ghost. I longed to break free from his arms, to mount a horse and ride until my body shook with exhaustion, to crawl at the feet of the only man who could make me whole again. My breasts still heavy with milk, my cunt still wet from dreaming of him, I knew what I had to do. The lie of this marriage bed was suffocating; only in his hall, under his weight, split open by his cock, could I breathe again. Tomorrow, I would leave. I would find [real_father.GetFirstName], and I would beg him to ruin me."
bno_black_birth.2101.a: "Only [real_father.GetFirstName] seed can fill me again."

bno_black_birth.2102.title: "The Hollow Embrace"
bno_black_birth.2102.desc: "I held [mother.GetFirstName] close, her golden hair spilling across my chest like silk, her skin soft and pale in the afterglow of our union. My cock still twitched weakly from the exertion, seed spilled into her as duty demanded, and yet even as I kissed her temple and whispered my devotion, I felt the distance. Her body yielded, but her sighs were not for me. Her gaze wandered when she thought I did not notice, eyes half-lidded, lost in some hunger I could not sate. The weight of her breasts against me, still swollen with milk, made me ache with the reminder that another had marked her, claimed her in ways I could never undo.\n\nI pretended sleep, though my heart pounded with dread. I could feel her restlessness, the subtle tension of her thighs rubbing together, her breath quickening as if remembering a different embrace. She clutched me as if to convince herself, but her warmth was elsewhere, her womb still loyal to a man whose name she dared not whisper aloud in this bed. A king in crown only, I lay still as stone, knowing that soon she would rise, saddle a horse, and ride away from me. Away to him."
bno_black_birth.2102.a: "I give her all I have, yet it is never enough."

bno_black_birth.2201.title: "Milk and Shame — The Queen Returns"
bno_black_birth.2201.desc: "The long ride to his hall left me trembling, not from cold but from the ache inside me that only he could soothe. I slipped from my horse at the gates, no crown, no entourage, only a needy whore in silks, crawling across his polished stone until I reached the feet of the man who had broken me open. My milk still leaked, soaking my gown, heavy breasts straining as I pressed my face to his boots. My cunt clenched at the memory of him splitting me, thick and brutal, planting the child whose skin betrayed us both. Shame burned in my cheeks, but lust made me shameless—I begged with my eyes, lips trembling, desperate for the stretch of his cock to remind me who I belonged to.\n\nWhen he lifted me by the hair, the weight of his presence crushed me deeper than any crown ever had. My body throbbed with a hunger the pale king had never fed, a hunger carved into me by every drop of seed he spilled in me. I whispered, sobbed, pleaded for his cock, promising my womb again, promising I would never close my legs to him, not even for a moment. My breasts leaked, thighs slick, every inch of me betraying the queen’s mask I wore at court. Here, I was only his broodmare, aching to be filled, bred, owned."
bno_black_birth.2201.a: "Fill me, breed me, I can’t live without it."

bno_black_birth.2202.title: "Milk and Shame — What Remains"
bno_black_birth.2202.desc: "The bed was cold when I reached for her. At first, I thought she had only risen to tend to the child, but as the moments stretched into hours, dread coiled tight in my chest. I summoned a servant, and with downcast eyes he confessed what I already feared: [mother.GetFirstName] had ridden out before dawn, cloaked and veiled, no escort but her own urgency. I went to the window and watched the empty road beyond the gates, knowing exactly where she had gone. My queen, my wife, the mother of the child I called my own—she had left my embrace to crawl back to him.\n\nThe shame gnawed at me as I imagined her arrival in his hall, milk-soaked breasts bared, thighs trembling with need, begging to be split open by the cock that had already blackened my line. I pressed my fists to the sill until my knuckles cracked, but I could not chase her. What claim did I have? She would return sore and smiling, her body heavy with his seed again, and I would be expected to hold her, to pretend. The crown sat heavy on my head, yet I felt smaller than any man, watching the woman I loved gallop willingly into another’s arms."
bno_black_birth.2202.a: "She has left me for him, and I am powerless."
bno_black_birth.2202.b: "I will take her back, even knowing she returns ruined."

bno_black_birth.2203.title: "Milk and Shame — The Queen Returns"
bno_black_birth.2203.desc: "She came to me in the dead of night, silks damp from the road, eyes wide with need. [mother.GetFirstName] fell to her knees before I even rose from the bed, her pale breasts heavy with milk that had soaked through her gown, her thighs trembling as if her cunt had already remembered me. I looked down at her, this crowned whore who had crossed kingdoms to crawl back to me, and I felt my cock swell with pride. She whispered my name—#EMP [real_father.GetFirstName]#!—like a prayer, her lips pressed to the dark skin of my thigh, begging without words for me to make her whole again.\n\nI lifted her by the hair, dragging her up until her breasts pressed to my chest, milk streaking my skin as she gasped against me. The pale king could keep his crown; I had her womb, her milk, her body bent to my will. I shoved her against the bed and watched her cunt quiver open, wet and aching, already leaking as if her body had been waiting for me since the day I bred her last. She moaned, legs spread wide, and I drove myself inside her, each thrust drowning her shame beneath the sound of her cries. This was no queen in my chamber—only my broodmare, dripping, ruined, and desperate for every drop of seed I would give her."
bno_black_birth.2203.a: "I will breed you again, until no man doubts whose you are."

bno_black_birth.2303.title: "Milk and Shame — Claimed Again"
bno_black_birth.2303.desc: "Her body opened for me the moment I drove into her, slick and needy, pale thighs trembling as I forced my cock deeper into the cunt that had ached for me since her last betrayal. [mother.GetFirstName] clawed at the sheets, milk spilling from her swollen breasts in hot streams across her silk bodice, her cries rising higher with each thrust. I gripped her hips and hammered her into the mattress, my balls slapping against her soft flesh, the wet slap of our joining echoing off stone walls like the sound of victory. She sobbed my name into the bedspread, voice breaking, begging me never to stop, begging me to fill her until she forgot the king’s touch forever.\n\nI flipped her onto her back, forcing her legs wide so I could watch her face contort with every brutal plunge. Her pale skin glistened with sweat, golden hair plastered to her cheeks, her nipples dripping milk that spattered across her chest each time I slammed into her. She wrapped her arms around me, holding on as though she would shatter without me inside her, whispering she was mine, only mine. My cock throbbed with the heat of her submission, seed already rising in my gut, and when she screamed, back arching, cunt squeezing tight, I crushed my mouth to hers and emptied myself deep inside her womb. Thick, hot streams painted her insides, her body quivering as it drank down my claim. The queen was gone; only my breeding whore remained, bound to me by the ache between her legs and the milk that spilled with every thrust."

[mother.GetFirstName] screamed, a raw broken sound, her back arching so high her milk sprayed in hot streams across her chest and onto my skin. Her juices poured down her thighs, soaking the sheets, splashing against my balls as I pounded harder, chasing the edge that had been burning in me since the moment she crawled through my doors. She thrashed under me, sobbing my name, choking on her moans, her entire body surrendering to the ruin I gave her.\n\nI roared into her mouth as the dam broke inside me, cock jerking deep in her womb, spilling my seed in heavy, molten ropes. My balls slapped her ass with every final thrust, forcing it all inside, pumping her full until it leaked back out around me, thick and hot, mixing with the flood of her own climax. She writhed, legs wrapped around my waist, desperate to hold every drop, milky tits heaving, cunt milking me greedily as if her body refused to let me go. When I collapsed against her, chest to chest, both of us shuddering in the aftermath, the room stank of sex and sweat and spilled milk. She was mine again, marked and bred, my broodmare filled with the proof of her betrayal."

My body betrayed every ounce of shame, clinging to him, cunt spasming around his cock like it had been waiting all these months just to be split apart again. My breasts spilled milk down my gown, soaking my skin as I clutched at the sheets, sobbing his name between the wet smacks of his thrusts. Every time he bottomed out I felt the emptiness of my husband’s seed mocked, my womb stretched and filled by the only man who could truly claim me.\n\nHe flipped me onto my back, holding my legs open wide so I could see him driving deeper and deeper into me. My voice cracked, moans spilling uncontrollably, tears wetting my cheeks even as I begged him not to stop, to ruin me more, to drown me with his seed. My belly clenched with every brutal stroke, my body leaking, my nipples squirting across my chest as he fucked me harder than I could bear. The world outside no longer mattered; my crown, my vows, even my shame melted beneath the truth of his cock. I was nothing but his broodmare, his black-bred slut, and I came undone knowing I would never escape what he had made me."

My juices flooded the sheets, soaking my thighs, splashing against his heavy balls as he slammed me harder. I begged with every sob, begged him to give it to me, to drown my womb again, to mark me as his, and when I felt his cock throb and swell inside me, I shattered.\n\nThe heat of his seed hit me in thick, endless waves, each gush forcing a sob from my throat. I clawed at his back, legs wrapped tight around him, desperate to hold him in, desperate to keep every drop inside.

bno_black_birth.2402.desc: "I should have stayed in my chambers, pretended ignorance as I always did, but some sickness in me dragged me here. Through the half-open doors of [real_father.GetFirstName]’s chamber I saw her—my wife, my queen, [mother.GetFirstName]—writhing beneath him, her pale body trembling as his monstrous cock hammered her open. Her breasts leaked milk in messy streams, soaking her gown and his dark skin, her sobbing cries of pleasure louder than any moan she had ever given me. My hand betrayed me, stroking furiously at the pitiful length between my legs, precum smearing my fingers as I watched another man breed her deeper than I ever could.\n\nEvery thrust shook her, every roar from him made me flinch, yet I could not look away. She clung to him, begging for more, begging for his seed, her body gushing with wetness that mocked the feeble duty I had given her earlier in our marriage bed.
