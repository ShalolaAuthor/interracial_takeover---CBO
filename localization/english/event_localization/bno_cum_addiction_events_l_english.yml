bno_cum_addiction.0000.title: "Marking Prey"
bno_cum_addiction.0000.desc: "The pale little slut lingers at the edge of the hall, pretending to busy herself with trifles. But I see the way her eyes flicker toward me, the way her breath hitches when I draw near. She has not yet tasted me, but already her body betrays her—cheeks flushed, thighs pressed tight.\n\nIt would be so simple to close the space, to make her mine here and now. But better to savor her weakness, to draw her into the snare. A word, a glance, a brush of my hand against her throat—small sparks that will blaze into hunger. She will fall, and once she tastes my seed, she will never rise again."
bno_cum_addiction.0000.a: "#EMP I will tease her slowly, make her crave what I carry.#!"
bno_cum_addiction.0000.b: "#EMP I will corner her, whisper filth until she trembles.#!"
bno_cum_addiction.0000.c: "#EMP I will seize her chin and remind her who her master will be.#!"

bno_cum_addiction.0001.title: "Strings of Desire"
bno_cum_addiction.0001.desc: "He doesn’t pounce. He doesn’t seize me like some beast in rut. Instead, he lets his presence curl around me, slow and suffocating, a heat that coils tighter with every heartbeat. I steal glances at him, praying no one notices the flush rising on my cheeks, but every time I do, his lips curve in that knowing smile.\n\nA brush of his hand against my sleeve makes my breath catch. He leans close as though to whisper something innocent, but his words drip with filth only I can hear. “You’d look so pretty on your knees,” he murmurs, and my thighs clench so hard I nearly stumble. I should slap him, run from him, cry out for decency—but I don’t. I just stand there, trembling, the thought burning itself into my mind.\n\nHe doesn’t force me. That’s the worst part. He only withdraws, his touch gone too soon, leaving me aching for what he didn’t give. My lips part as though to beg, but he’s already stepping away, content to leave me drowning in need. I stare after him, heart pounding, thighs damp, knowing I will dream of him tonight."
bno_cum_addiction.0001.a: "#EMP P-please… don’t stop teasing me…#!"
bno_cum_addiction.0001.b: "#EMP N-no, I won’t let you play with me like this!#!"

bno_cum_addiction.1001.title: "Toying With Her Fire"
bno_cum_addiction.1001.desc: "She keeps glancing at me—those wide blue eyes snapping away the moment I meet them, her cheeks burning, her lips wet from nervous licks. A shy little slut, ripe for teasing. I don’t rush; there’s no need. My presence alone makes her fidget with her skirts, thighs pressed together as if she could hold back the heat rising in her belly.\n\nI step close enough that she feels the warmth of my body without a touch. Her breath hitches. I lower my voice so only she can hear. “You’re trembling already,” I murmur, lips brushing the shell of her ear. She gasps, clutching her chest, and I let my hand graze her wrist, barely a touch—then withdraw. Her body sways after me, desperate for more.\n\nShe doesn’t say a word of protest. No slap, no retreat. Instead, she stands there, flushed and panting, her eyes wide and wet, begging me silently to keep playing. I grin. She likes it. The little slut likes being teased until her cunt soaks through her gown. She’ll come back to me now—because she needs the fire I’ve lit to be stoked again."
bno_cum_addiction.1001.a: "I’ll let her simmer, make her burn until she begs."

bno_cum_addiction.2001.title: "Walls of Ice"
bno_cum_addiction.2001.desc: "I draw close, my words low and smooth, a touch brushing her arm as I whisper filth into her ear. But instead of the flush of heat, I see her lips tighten, her chin lift in defiance. Her eyes flash with something sharper than curiosity—anger, maybe pride.\n\nShe jerks away from my hand as though it burns her, shoulders stiff, cheeks pink not with desire but with indignation. “How dare you,” she hisses, eyes darting around the hall as if afraid someone might have seen. She’s shaking, but not the way I wanted. For now, she resists, hiding behind walls of propriety, clinging to scraps of dignity.\n\nI grin anyway. She can deny me with her mouth all she likes—her cunt will betray her soon enough. The seed of corruption is planted. All I need is time."
bno_cum_addiction.2001.a: "Push harder, test those walls until they crack."

bno_cum_addiction.0002.title: "Pinned by Words"
bno_cum_addiction.0002.desc: "He steps closer, and I feel my back press into the cold stone wall. My heart hammers, my breath catching as his shadow falls over me. I should cry out, call for help, but his voice comes low and heavy, dripping with filth meant only for my ears.\n\n“You’re dripping already, aren’t you? A pretty little slut pretending to be proper…” His words strike deeper than hands ever could. My thighs clamp together, a feeble shield against the molten ache pooling between them. My lips tremble as I try to deny it, but the truth slips through my body—my nipples hard beneath the fabric, my breath ragged, my eyes refusing to meet his.\n\nHe leans closer, so close his breath brushes my cheek. “Say it,” he growls softly, “say you want your Bull to ruin you.” The shame burns hotter than fire, but gods help me, the shame only makes me wetter. I shake, trapped between disgust at myself and the unbearable hunger swelling in my belly."
bno_cum_addiction.0002.a: "#EMP Y-yes… gods forgive me, I want it…#!"
bno_cum_addiction.0002.b: "#EMP N-no! I won’t say it—I won’t!#!"

bno_cum_addiction.1002.title: "Her Walls Crumble"
bno_cum_addiction.1002.desc: "Her back hits the stone wall with a soft gasp, her eyes wide, lips trembling. I don’t touch her, not yet. I let my words coil into her ears, filth dripping like honey, each syllable slicing through the thin veil of dignity she clings to.\n\n“Look at you,” I murmur, my voice low, intimate, inescapable. “Shaking already… wet through your silks. You want your Bull to ruin you.” Her lips part, stammering denials that twist into moans. I see the fight drain from her eyes, replaced with that feverish glow—shame and hunger colliding until she can’t tell them apart.\n\nI step closer, close enough to feel the heat rolling off her body. She doesn’t move away—she tilts her chin, offering her throat without even realizing it. That’s when I smile, slow and cruel. The corner isn’t stone anymore—it’s me. She’s pinned by my words, by the truth burning in her belly. She’s mine already, and she knows it."
bno_cum_addiction.1002.a: "I’ll brush my lips to her ear, whisper more filth until she begs."

bno_cum_addiction.2002.title: "A Wall Too High"
bno_cum_addiction.2002.desc: "I step into her space, pressing her back against the cold stone, my voice low and dripping with filth. I expect the blush, the trembling—but instead her body stiffens like a drawn bow. Her eyes narrow, her lips flatten into a hard line.\n\n“You will not speak to me that way,” she spits, the words sharp despite the quiver in her voice. Her cheeks are flushed, but this time it’s fury, not desire. She glares up at me, chest heaving, her fists tight at her sides. She’d rather choke on her pride than admit what my words stir in her belly.\n\nI chuckle, stepping back just enough to let her breathe, but not enough to free her from my shadow. She thinks she’s safe behind her wall of ice. Let her. I’ve seen the flicker in her eyes, the way her thighs pressed together even as she tried to snarl. Denial won’t save her—it will only make the fall sweeter."
bno_cum_addiction.2002.a: "Let her go—for now. Her shame will gnaw at her."

bno_cum_addiction.0003.title: "Held in His Grip"
bno_cum_addiction.0003.desc: "His hand closes around my chin before I can flinch away. Strong, unyielding, his fingers dig into my cheeks, tilting my face up until I’m staring into his eyes. My breath catches, a sharp whimper trapped in my throat as heat floods me from the force of his hold.\n\nThere’s no room to pretend, no space for modesty. His grip tells me what I am—small, weak, a pale slut caught in the grasp of something bigger. Shame burns across my skin, but my thighs press together, desperate to ease the ache he awakens with nothing more than his touch.\n\n“You belong to me,” he growls, and I shudder as the words strike harder than any blow. My lips part, trembling, not to deny him but to breathe, to beg, to surrender. The wall behind me feels cold, his hand feels hot, and I know I’ll never escape the weight of this claim."
bno_cum_addiction.0003.a: "#EMP Please… don’t let go…#!"
bno_cum_addiction.0003.b: "#EMP N-no! You can’t treat me like this!#!"

bno_cum_addiction.1003.title: "Claimed by My Hand"
bno_cum_addiction.1003.desc: "Her soft little chin fits perfectly in my palm as I tilt her face up to me. I feel her trembling—not from fear, but from arousal—and the corners of her lips twitch into a helpless pout. She should resist, should slap me, but instead her eyes glaze with that sweet, needy shine that tells me everything. She wants this. She wants me to hold her like property.\n\nI squeeze harder, just enough to make her whimper. Her thighs squeeze shut, betraying the heat flooding between them. “You’re mine now,” I growl, watching her mouth fall open, breathless, ready to agree before I’ve even demanded it. She’s lost already. With a single touch, I’ve broken her mask of dignity and exposed the slut underneath.\n\nWhen I finally ease my grip, her face follows my hand, desperate to stay in my hold. I chuckle—she doesn’t even realize she’s leaning into me like a bitch begging for the collar. She’ll wear it soon enough."
bno_cum_addiction.1003.a: "I’ll press her harder, make her beg for the leash."

bno_cum_addiction.2003.title: "Defiant Eyes"
bno_cum_addiction.2003.desc: "My hand clamps around her soft little chin, tilting her face up so she can see the power that owns her. For a moment I expect the shudder, the surrender—but instead her eyes blaze with fury. She jerks against my grip, lips twisted in defiance.\n\n“Unhand me!” she snaps, her voice high and sharp, though I feel the tremble in her body. She struggles against my hold, not from lack of fear, but because pride won’t let her bend—yet. Her cheeks are flushed, her breath ragged, and I know it isn’t only anger that heats her, but she hides it well behind her glare.\n\nI let her go with a slow chuckle, watching her rub her reddened jaw, glaring as though she still had dignity. Let her spit, let her rage. The fire will burn her out soon enough, and when it does, she’ll beg to feel my hand on her chin again."
bno_cum_addiction.2003.a: "Her pride makes the breaking sweeter—I’ll enjoy it later."

bno_cum_addiction.0004.title.01: "On Her Knees in Secret"
bno_cum_addiction.0004.desc.01: "The door creaks softly in the night, and there she is—my pale little slut, cheeks flushed, eyes darting as though she fears the guards might see. She hesitates for only a heartbeat before stepping inside, her breath shallow, her body trembling with anticipation. She tries to hide her shame beneath a cloak, but I see how her thighs press together, her nipples hard beneath the thin shift.\n\nI don’t speak. I don’t need to. I sit back in my chair, spreading my legs, letting her see the shape of what she came for. Her lips part in a gasp, her gaze fixed on the bulge between my thighs. When I crook a finger, she falls to her knees as if she’s been waiting her whole life for this. Her hands tremble as she frees me, and then—warmth. Her soft mouth closes around me, her tongue sliding uncertainly at first, then with growing hunger.\n\nThe wet sounds fill the chamber, her moans muffled around my cock. I rest my hand on her head, guiding her rhythm, and when I spill down her throat she chokes, then swallows—her eyes wide, tears streaming, lips glossy with seed. She pulls back gasping, but instead of fleeing, she licks her lips, moaning softly at the taste. Her first swallow. She’s mine now."
bno_cum_addiction.0004.a.01: "I’ll pat her head, reward her like the pet she is."

bno_cum_addiction.0004.title.02: "The Taste That Lingers"
bno_cum_addiction.0004.desc.02: "The court disperses, the hall still echoing with laughter and clatter, but she lingers behind, pretending to study a tapestry. I see her glance over her shoulder, cheeks pink, lips parted as though she’s holding her breath. I don’t give her the chance to flee. A step forward, a hand around her wrist, and I tug her into the shadow of an empty corridor.\n\nShe gasps, wide-eyed, but doesn’t pull away when I free myself before her. Her blush deepens, her gaze riveted to the heavy shaft in my hand. “On your knees,” I murmur, and she obeys, skirts rustling as she sinks before me. Her hands tremble as she takes me, her lips brushing the head. The first timid lick makes her whimper, but soon her mouth stretches, swallowing more of me.\n\nI groan as her wet tongue laps hungrily, her cheeks hollowing as she sucks, the wet sounds loud in the quiet corridor. Her throat clenches when I push deeper, her eyes watering, yet she doesn’t stop. When I cum, thick and hot, she chokes but swallows—her eyes wide, her face sticky with sweat and tears.\n\nShe pulls back, panting, her lips glossy with seed, and then—she licks them. Slowly. Shame flushes her cheeks, but her eyes glaze as though drunk. Later, across the hall, I catch her tongue darting out again, tasting her lips as if the memory alone could feed her. She’s hooked already—the taste lingers, and she’ll crave more."
bno_cum_addiction.0004.a.02: "I’ll let her go, knowing the hunger will gnaw at her."

bno_cum_addiction.0004.title.03: "The Goblet Trick"
bno_cum_addiction.0004.desc.03: "The hall is alive with music and chatter, nobles drinking and feasting beneath banners and torchlight. She slips away from the laughter, clutching a silver goblet, her cheeks flushed with wine. I follow, cornering her by the trestle table where the servants refill the cups. She startles when she sees me, eyes widening as I pluck the goblet from her hand.\n\nWithout a word, I tug my cock free, heavy and throbbing, and dip it into her wine. Thick drops of seed swirl in the dark red, clouding it white as I stir. She gasps, scandalized, her hands frozen in shock. But when I press the goblet back into her grip and step close, she trembles. My voice is a growl meant only for her ears: “Drink. Let your first taste be mine.”\n\nHer lips tremble, eyes darting to the crowded hall where no one notices, then back to me. She should refuse, should slap the cup away—but instead she raises it, hesitating only a heartbeat before sipping. The flavor coats her tongue, and she shudders, pink rising on her cheeks as she swallows again, moaning softly.\n\nLater, I catch her slipping under the long banquet table, the cloth hiding her from view. My cock stiffens the moment her hot mouth wraps around it, eager to erase the memory of wine and taste the source instead. Her tongue works desperately, her moans vibrating down my shaft as I cum in her mouth. She drinks greedily, licking her lips clean when she pulls away.\n\nThe feast continues above, none the wiser. Only I and my pale little whore know what she truly drank tonight."
bno_cum_addiction.0004.a.03: "I’ll keep her hidden under the table until she’s choking on more."

bno_cum_addiction.0004.title.04: "Whimper in the Dark"
bno_cum_addiction.0004.desc.04: "The chapel is nearly empty, candles flickering low, shadows dancing on stone saints who watch with cold eyes. She kneels at the altar as if in prayer, her pale hair glowing in the firelight. But I see the way her hands shake, the way her thighs squeeze together beneath her gown. She prays for strength—but what she truly wants is me.\n\nI step into the alcove, cock already hard and straining, and her gasp breaks the silence. She doesn’t run. She doesn’t even rise. She just stares, wide-eyed, lips parting as I grip her hair and guide her mouth open. “Pray with this,” I growl, pressing the head between her lips.\n\nThe sound is obscene in the quiet chapel—wet sucking, gagging whimpers muffled around my shaft. Her hands clutch at my thighs like a penitent clings to rosary beads, her eyes watering as I push deeper, forcing devotion into her throat. She moans around me, the vibrations sending fire down my cock.\n\nWhen I spill, hot seed gushes into her mouth, and she swallows frantically, drooling what she can’t keep down. It stains her chin, glistening in the candlelight. She gasps, lips swollen, chest heaving, then clasps her hands as if in prayer—seed still coating her tongue. Her voice is hoarse, but her words spill out: “Forgive me, but I… I need more.”\n\nEven the saints can’t save her now."
bno_cum_addiction.0004.a.04: "I’ll push her back down, make her worship longer at my altar"

bno_cum_addiction.0004.title.05: "The Taste Test"
bno_cum_addiction.0004.desc.05: "I sit with her alone, the chamber quiet but for the crackle of the hearth. She perches on the edge of the bed, nervous, her hands twisting at her lap as if she can hold in the hunger burning through her. I tug my cock free, already hard, and stroke until a thick bead of seed glistens at the tip.\n\n“Open,” I command, and though her cheeks burn red, her lips part obediently. I smear the drop across them, watching it glisten on her skin. “Now tell me,” I growl, “what does your Bull’s seed taste like?”\n\nHer tongue flickers out, tentative at first, then desperate, chasing every trace of my cum into her mouth. She stammers, cheeks wet with shame, “I-it’s warm… thick… salty… addictive.” I laugh, pushing more onto her tongue, making her lap at it like a bitch.\n\nWhen I finally thrust into her mouth, she moans around the shaft, sucking greedily. My seed spills down her throat, dripping from her lips, and I force her to swallow every drop. She gasps when I pull back, cum smeared across her face, then licks her lips again—moaning softly, already aching for the next taste.\n\nThe test is over. The results are clear: she’s mine, a slave to the flavor of my cock."
bno_cum_addiction.0004.a.05: "I’ll shove deeper, make her throat choke on my taste."

bno_cum_addiction.1004.title.01: "On Her Knees in Secret"
bno_cum_addiction.1004.desc.01: "The corridor is dark and silent when I slip inside, heart hammering in my chest. I shouldn’t be here. If anyone sees, if anyone knows… but my body won’t obey reason. My lips still burn from dreaming of him, my cunt still leaks at the thought of what he carries.\n\nHe doesn’t speak when I find him. He just sits back, eyes heavy, legs spreading to reveal what I came for. The sight makes my breath catch—thick, dark, impossibly large. My knees buckle, and before I even think, I’m kneeling, skirts pooling around me like a whore’s offering. My hands tremble as I free him, my throat dry, my cheeks burning.\n\nWhen I part my lips, the heat fills me—heavy, hot, the taste already coating my tongue. I choke, tears spilling down my cheeks, but I can’t stop. I suck harder, desperate to please, desperate for more. His hand presses to the back of my head, and I whimper as he fills me, thick spurts of seed gushing down my throat.\n\nI gag, I cough, but I swallow, swallowing again and again until it’s gone. My lips are sticky, my chin wet with drool and cum. Shame scorches me, yet I lick my lips, moaning softly. The taste won’t leave me, and the hunger won’t fade. I know I’ll crawl back to him—I can’t live without that heat inside me again."

bno_cum_addiction.1004.desc.02: "The court has emptied, voices fading into the night, yet I remain, pretending to study the woven figures on the wall. My cheeks burn, my body restless, because I know he’s watching me. When his hand closes around my wrist and he draws me into the shadows, I don’t resist.\n\nHe bares himself before me, thick and heavy, and my breath catches. My lips part before I can stop them. “On your knees,” he commands, and my legs fold as if by instinct. I tremble as I take him in hand, then in mouth—hot, heavy, stretching my lips. The taste fills me, bitter and thick, making my eyes water, my thighs squeeze together.\n\nWhen he spills, the heat floods my throat, choking me. I cough, drool spilling, but I swallow, gulping down his seed. My face is wet with tears and spit, my chest heaves, yet when I pull back, my tongue darts out to lick what remains. I moan softly, ashamed, but unable to stop.\n\nLater, as I return to the hall, I press my lips together, tasting him still. I try to sip wine, to eat bread, but nothing satisfies. My tongue sneaks out again and again, chasing that flavor, each flick sending a pulse of heat to my cunt. No one else notices, but I know—I’ve changed. His seed lingers on my lips, in my mind, in my very flesh. I can’t be rid of it. I don’t want to."

I clutch my cup tight, trying to steady my hands, but when he comes to me my heart leaps into my throat. He takes the goblet from my grasp without a word, and my breath stutters as I watch him dip his cock into the wine.\n\nThick drops swirl in the dark red, clouding it pale, tainting it with him. My cheeks burn scarlet as he stirs, then presses it back into my hands. “Drink,” he whispers, so low no one else can hear. “Drink your Bull’s gift.”\n\nMy stomach twists, my eyes darting to the nobles around us—none of them see, none of them know. Shame claws at me, but the heat between my thighs flares hotter. I raise the cup, trembling, and sip. The taste coats my tongue—rich wine cut with something heavier, saltier, hotter. I moan softly into the rim, unable to stop, and swallow again.\n\nThe rest of the hall blurs around me. My lips are slick, my body trembling. Later, when the feast continues above, I crawl under the tablecloth, clutching at his thighs. My mouth finds him in the dark, desperate to replace the memory of wine with the true taste, the source itself. I suck greedily, drooling, swallowing every hot spurt as my Bull spills into my throat.\n\nNo one above notices—but I know. And I know I’ll never drink anything else the same way again."

But it isn’t God I beg for—it’s him. My thighs are damp beneath my gown, my heart racing at the thought of his dark eyes upon me.\n\nA shadow falls across me. I glance up and see him—towering, silent, his cock already hard, glistening in the candlelight. My breath catches. I should scream, should flee, but instead my lips part, trembling, welcoming. His hand grips my hair, tugging me closer, and I whimper as the head presses against my tongue.\n\nThe taste is overwhelming—hot, bitter, divine. The chapel fills with obscene sounds as I choke and suck, gagging softly while the saints stare down with unseeing stone eyes. Tears streak my cheeks, drool runs from my lips, and yet I moan, moan into his flesh like a penitent at prayer.\n\nWhen he spills, thick seed floods my throat, and I swallow frantically, gulping, some of it dribbling down my chin to stain my gown. My lips are sticky, my chest heaves, and still my tongue licks at him, greedy, desperate for every drop. I press my hands together again, as if in prayer, and whisper hoarsely, “Forgive me… but I need more.”\n\nEven here, in God’s house, I’ve become nothing but his whore."

The taste coats me—salty, bitter, thick—and I moan despite myself. “I-it’s… warm,” I stammer, cheeks burning, “thick… heavy… gods forgive me… addictive.” The word leaves me broken, my cunt soaking, my lips trembling.\n\nHe smears more across my mouth, forcing me to lap it up like a bitch. My tongue obeys, hungry, eager, no longer waiting. When he pushes inside, I moan around him, drooling, choking as thick spurts gush down my throat. I swallow greedily, my belly burning, my mind spinning, until my lips shine with cum.\n\nI sit there panting, face painted, my tongue darting again to lick the last drops.

bno_cum_addiction.0005.desc.01: "It has been days since I last let her drink, and the withdrawal shows. Her eyes are hollow, her cheeks flushed, her hands trembling as though from fever. I find her in the stables, the scent of hay mixing with her sweat, her whole body quaking with need. The moment she sees me, she collapses onto her knees, skirts pooling in filth, her hands clawing at my thighs.\n\n“Please,” she whines, her voice cracked and hoarse. “I can’t sleep, I can’t eat, I can’t think… I need you.” Her eyes shine with tears, her lips swollen from being bitten raw in frustration. Before I can answer, she’s already tugging at my cock, dragging it free, her breath hot and frantic as she buries her face in it.\n\nHer mouth is wild at first, sloppy, drool spilling down her chin as she moans around me, gagging and choking but never stopping. Her cunt soaks through her gown as she humps the ground like a bitch in heat, all while her throat works to drink every drop I give her. When I finally spill, she screams into my cock, gulping greedily, the sound of her swallowing louder than the snorts of the horses.\n\nWhen it’s done, she collapses forward, forehead pressed to my thigh, gasping in relief. Her whole body slackens, as though my seed alone has cured her illness. I chuckle, gripping her hair, smearing the last drops across her lips. She licks them clean without hesitation, eyes glazed, whispering brokenly, “Thank you… thank you, my Bull…”"

bno_cum_addiction.0005.desc.02: "The dawn is pale, the chamber still heavy with sleep, when I stir to the faintest wet sound beneath the furs. My eyes open to find her already there, a pale silhouette kneeling between my legs, her lips wrapped tight around my cock. She whimpers softly, her cheeks hollowing as she sucks, drool pooling at her chin.\n\nShe doesn’t wait for my permission. She doesn’t even think I’m awake. She moans low in her throat, rocking back and forth as if my cock were air in her lungs. When I grunt, her eyes flick up, wide with shame—then immediately glaze over again, drunk with relief at the taste she’s been craving all night.\n\nHer cunt is dripping through her shift, the scent of her lust thick in the air. She humps against the bedpost, grinding herself while her mouth works faster, desperate to draw every drop from me. I fist her hair, pulling her down, and she gags, tears streaking her flushed cheeks as she takes me deeper. Her body shakes as though she’s climaxing already from the act alone.\n\nWhen my seed floods her throat, she moans like a starving woman given food. She gulps noisily, drool and cum spilling past her lips, soaking her chest. Even after I finish, she keeps sucking, trembling with need, until I force her back. She pants, her face wet and shining, whispering, “Please, don’t stop me… I need more, always more…”\n\nI laugh, pulling her onto the bed by her hair.

I feel her hands clutching at my thighs, trembling with hunger, before her lips wrap around me.\n\nShe moans into my cock, the sound muffled by the feast above. Her tongue swirls, her throat tightens as she swallows me deeper, desperate to sate the gnawing hunger that’s consumed her since I last fed her. A goblet clatters, nobles laugh, a bard sings—but none of them know the wet, obscene sounds beneath their feet.\n\nI glance around the table, smirking as I keep my composure, while below she drools and gags, choking softly but never stopping. Her cunt must be dripping onto the stone floor, her body rocking in time with her sucking. When I grip her hair and hold her down, she shudders, eyes watering, throat convulsing until hot spurts gush straight into her stomach.\n\nShe drinks greedily, gulping like a bitch at the trough. Cum dribbles past her lips, staining her chin, soaking her bodice. She doesn’t pull away—she licks, moans, suckles for more, long after I’ve finished. When she finally crawls out from under, her cheeks are flushed, her lips swollen, her eyes glazed. The nobles smile at her politeness, not knowing her mouth is still slick with seed.\n\nShe leans close, whispering with trembling lips, “Thank you, my Bull… I can’t go without you anymore.”"

Her lips part in a needy whimper, and then she’s on me—sloppy, wet, sucking like she’s been starving. Drool streams down her chin, soaking her shift, her moans echoing low and guttural as she bobs her head faster and faster. I fist her hair and guide her deeper, until she gags, tears spilling down her cheeks, yet she never pulls away.\n\nHer cunt drips onto the floor, her thighs squeezing together as she humps the air while choking on my cock. She looks up through tear-stained lashes, eyes pleading, begging, worshipping. When I cum, she screams into my shaft, gulping it all down, throat working frantically as if my seed were the only thing keeping her alive.\n\nWhen it’s done, she sags forward, resting her cheek against my thigh, gasping in relief, lips still pressed to the base of my cock. “Thank you,” she whispers hoarsely, voice thick with seed. “I needed it… I need you every night.” Her hunger is no longer a secret—it is her life now."

She doesn’t resist. She opens wide, whimpering softly as I press her lips down, stretching her mouth around me. Gasps ripple through the crowd, but she moans louder, gagging as I sink deeper, drool spilling over her chin. Her cheeks hollow, her eyes glaze, her cunt dripping into her skirts as she sucks noisily, shamelessly, in front of them all.\n\nI fist her hair, forcing her to choke, tears streaming down her flushed face, while my court looks on. She doesn’t care—she worships me openly, her mouth sloppy and eager, swallowing every drop as I flood her throat. When I pull her off, seed still dripping from her lips, she clasps her hands like a penitent, whispering breathlessly, “Thank you, my Bull.”\n\nLaughter, whispers, even scandal doesn’t touch me.

She stumbles from her bench, hands trembling, her body pulling toward me as though some divine leash tugs at her neck. She collapses at my feet, drooling, eyes glassy with hunger. Before I speak a word, her mouth is on me—sloppy, desperate, worshipful.\n\nThe sound echoes through the hall—slurp, gag, moan—as she forces my cock into her throat, choking but never pulling back.

The saints look on, helpless stone witnesses to her new faith.\n\nWhen I spill, hot seed gushes over her tongue, and she swallows in trembling gulps, clasping her hands once more, whispering hoarsely, “Amen.” Cum dribbles down her chin, mixing with her tears, and she licks the last drops from my cock like a starving pilgrim.\n\nI laugh low, gripping her hair and smearing my seed across her flushed cheeks. “This is your prayer now,” I tell her, dragging my cock across her lips until she kisses it like a relic.

She opens without protest, lips parting like the mouth of a chalice, her whimper drowned by the raucous laughter around us.\n\nThe music falters as her gagging fills the hall.

The moment she frees me, her lips are on me, sucking frantically, drool cascading down her chin. She moans around my shaft, gagging with every thrust, her cunt dripping noisily onto the floorboards. She’s not here to serve—she’s here to survive.\n\nI fist her hair and hold her down, watching her throat bulge, her eyes rolling back as she gags and sputters. Her hands claw at me, not to escape, but to pull me deeper. When I cum, she squeals into my cock, gulping greedily, swallowing until her belly swells with seed. Even then she doesn’t stop—her head bobs weakly, lips slurping, as if she believes more will flow if she worships long enough.\n\nWhen I finally drag her back, her face is soaked with spit and cum, her chest heaving. She slumps against my thigh, drooling my seed back onto the floor, whispering in delirium: “I’m full… so full… I can’t stop… I need you again…”\n\nI laugh, low and cruel, stroking her messy hair. She isn’t noble, isn’t even human anymore—she’s cum-drunk, a mindless vessel who wanders through the night to find her only purpose: drinking from my cock until her dreams and waking life are one and the same."

Her eyes see nothing but the cock swinging heavy between my thighs.\n\nShe moans at the sight, a guttural, broken sound, and collapses against my legs like a pilgrim at a shrine. Her lips press reverently to my shaft, kissing, licking, sobbing as she whispers prayers too soft to hear. I grab her hair and force her mouth open, and she whimpers in ecstasy as I plunge into her throat.\n\nThe sound is obscene—slrk, gggkhh, slrp—her throat convulsing, her tears flowing freely. Drool and snot run down her chin, dripping onto her filthy gown. My men roar with laughter, mocking her, but she moans louder, gagging happily, her eyes rolling back as if in trance.

Cum dribbles down my chin into the dirt, and I lick it up greedily, smearing my face, whispering, “Sacred… holy… my Bull… my god…”\n\nThe warriors roar with laughter, pointing, mocking, but I hear none of it. I only hear my own prayers, my lips kissing him again and again, worshipping with tears, spit, and seed. I am not noble, not wife, not human. I am priestess, whore, relic-keeper. My faith is cum, my creed is cock, my salvation is him.\n\n[bno_bnwo|E] is not just law—it is religion. And I am proof, kneeling in the dirt with my mouth open, ready for the next sermon."

bno_cum_addiction.0007.desc.01: "The morning sun paints the courtyard gold, but all eyes are not on the banners or the rising day—they are on her. My slave. My prize. My proof. She kneels in the dirt before me, naked but for the iron collar around her throat, the chain clinking in my hand. Her pale skin is streaked with last night’s seed, her lips bruised from hours of sucking, her thighs still wet where her cunt leaks endlessly.\n\nThe warriors gather, their laughter booming as they watch her drool, her tongue lolling out, her eyes glazed with hunger. She does not hide it. She cannot. She trembles like a bitch in heat, moaning low in her throat, the chain tugging as she leans toward me. I take my time, stroking myself before her, letting the crowd jeer and spit. Her eyes widen, her whole body quakes, and when I finally shove her down, she sobs in ecstasy.\n\nHer mouth is not a mouth—it is a trough. I fuck her throat brutally, each thrust making her gag and retch, her tears streaking down her filthy face. Drool and snot pour freely, splattering onto the cobblestones, but the only sound louder than the warriors’ laughter is her own muffled moans. She loves it. She needs it. She is nothing without it.\n\nWhen I cum, it is not a gift—it is law. Hot seed gushes down her throat, and she squeals, gulping frantically, swallowing until her belly bulges. Cum dribbles from her nose, sprays from her lips, puddling in the dirt beneath her. She collapses forward, drooling and sobbing, licking at the ground to lap up what she’s lost.\n\nThe men roar, pointing and mocking, some spitting on her as she licks the stones clean. But I only smile. This is no woman. This is no wife, no daughter, no noble blood. This is Cum Slave—collared, broken, addicted, owned. And every soul in this courtyard knows it.\n\n[bno_bnwo|E] does not whisper in shadows. It rings in laughter, it drips from her mouth, it gleams in the iron collar that binds her. She is my sunrise, my slave, my victory carved into flesh."

bno_cum_addiction.0007.desc.02: "The chamber reeks of musk and heat, torches burning low, shadows flickering over the wooden frame at the center. She is bound there, my slave, my addict, my property. Wrists and ankles strapped wide, her back arched, her mouth pried open by the wooden gag that holds her ready. She moans through it, a sound not of fear but of devotion, her eyes locked on me the moment I step into the room.\n\nThe Bulls in the chamber laugh and jeer at her state, but she doesn’t hear them. She doesn’t see them. Her gaze is on me alone, begging with tears streaming down her cheeks. She squirms, her cunt dripping endlessly onto the straw below, not because of the room, not because of the frame, but because she knows her Bull is here.\n\nI stroke myself in front of her, and she sobs in relief. Her body thrashes against the bonds, desperate to be filled, desperate to drink, desperate for the one thing she is made for. When I step forward and thrust into her mouth, she cries out in ecstasy, her throat convulsing around me, drool pouring down her chin. She gags violently, but never pulls away—she can’t. My cock is her food, her wine, her god.\n\nThe room fills with the obscene sounds of her worship—slrk, glllkkhh, gag, moan. Her belly heaves with every gulp, her body quakes as orgasms ripple through her without my even touching her cunt. She is addicted, enslaved, chained not by the wood but by her need for my cum.\n\nWhen I flood her throat, she screams around me, gulping frantically, seed spilling from her nose, dripping onto her breasts. She swallows and swallows, desperate to keep every drop, as if starving to death. Even when her belly is swollen and her jaw hangs slack, her tongue lolls out, searching for more.\n\nThe Bulls cheer, but I don’t care for their noise. She is mine, bound to me, ruined for all others. Her mind is gone, her faith sealed, her existence rewritten. She is livestock in truth, but livestock that only I can feed. My seed is her law, her leash, her life."

But my throne overshadows it all, and what kneels beside me silences even the bravest tongue. She is chained at my side, collared in iron, the leash locked to the armrest. Naked, pale, her body smeared with my seed, she trembles, eyes glazed with that familiar hunger.\n\nEvery so often she tries to sit upright like a lady of the hall, but the need always wins. Her lips part, her tongue flicks out, her eyes roll toward me with desperate pleading. The nobles see it. They laugh, some whisper in disgust, others in envy. I don’t look at them. I look at her.\n\nI snap my fingers, and her body jerks like a puppet pulled by its strings. She crawls between my legs, chains clinking, mouth open before I even free myself. The chamber hushes, all eyes on her as my cock fills her throat. The obscene sounds echo—slrk, glllkkhh, gag, moan—as she gags and drools, tears streaking her cheeks. She doesn’t look at them. She doesn’t even know they exist. She looks only at me, whimpering through every thrust, begging for my cum.\n\nWhen I cum, she screams in muffled joy, gulping greedily, swallowing until her belly swells, until her chin glistens with overflow. She collapses against my thigh, chains rattling, whispering in broken gasps, “Thank you… my Bull… please, more…”\n\nThe nobles laugh, some jeer, some whisper with awe. But she doesn’t hear. There is no court, no hall, no kingdom. There is only me. My cock, my seed, my chain.\n\n[bno_bnwo|E] is not written in laws—it is written on her lips, in her swollen belly, in the iron that binds her forever to me. She is not a woman.

But the noise dies when I stride into the center, tugging the leash in my fist. She stumbles after me, collared and naked, her pale skin flushed, her thighs streaked with dried seed. The people gasp, some laugh, some spit—but their eyes never leave her.\n\nI drag her to the post, tie her leash high, and she whimpers—not with fear, but with aching need. Her eyes are locked on me, wide and wet, her lips parted, drool already glistening on her chin. She doesn’t notice the crowd pressing in. She doesn’t hear their jeers. She knows only one thing: her Bull has brought her here, and she must serve.\n\nI bare myself, heavy and swollen, and the gasp ripples through the square. Her eyes roll back, and she moans like a bitch in heat, straining against the collar, chains rattling as she crawls on her knees to reach me. She opens her mouth, wide and trembling, and I plunge in.\n\nThe market fills with the sound of her gagging devotion—slrk, glllkkhh, gag, moan—as I rut her throat mercilessly. Merchants drop their baskets, peasants stare wide-eyed, but I laugh as she chokes, drool splattering onto the cobbles, tears streaming down her ruined face. She doesn’t care. She doesn’t even know they’re there. All she knows is me, my cock, my seed.\n\nWhen I cum, it is not just for her—it is for them all. Thick, hot ropes flood her throat, spilling from her lips, dripping onto her naked chest. She gulps frantically, swallowing until she collapses at my feet, seed running down her chin. She licks the cobblestones, sobbing with joy, whispering, “Thank you, my Bull… thank you… I can’t live without you…”\n\nThe crowd murmurs, scandalized and afraid, but they see the truth carved in her body, written in her addiction. [bno_bnwo|E] is not law debated in halls—it is law displayed in the marketplace, a pale whore chained, choking, worshipping the only cock she will ever know."

She is stretched flat on her back, wrists and ankles tied to sturdy posts, her pale skin glistening with sweat, her cunt drooling down her thighs. Her jaw is forced open by the wooden gag, holding her mouth wide, her lips cracked from use. She doesn’t thrash. She doesn’t beg for release. She whimpers only one thing, over and over: “My Bull… please…”\n\nI strip myself bare, towering above her. Her eyes lock on me instantly—wild, glassy, desperate. The world is gone for her. There are no saints, no family, no duties. There is only the cock that owns her and the seed she craves. Her body arches in its bonds when I stroke myself, as though the sight alone makes her cum.\n\nI kneel over her, pressing my cock against her gaping lips. She squeals through the gag, not in pain but in bliss, her throat convulsing as I thrust deep. She gags violently, drool and snot spraying, but her eyes roll back in ecstasy. She moans around me, a garbled hymn, worshipping with every retch and choke.\n\nThe chamber fills with the rhythm of her slavery—slrk, glllkkhh, gag, choke. Her body jerks, cumming again and again, untouched, as if her orgasms are bound to the thrusts of my cock. When I cum, I do not dribble—I flood her throat, hot torrents gushing into her belly. She convulses, gulping frantically, seed spilling from her nose, bubbling at the corners of her mouth.\n\nShe swallows until her belly distends, sloshing audibly when I shake her bonds. Cum seeps from her lips, dripping down her neck onto her breasts, but her eyes stay locked on me, glowing with slavish devotion. She cannot speak, but her gaze screams the truth: more, more, always more.\n\nI laugh, low and cruel, smearing the overflow across her face. “You are no longer a woman,” I tell her. “You are my seedbed. My tank. My vessel.” She moans in delirious agreement, gagged mouth still stretched wide, waiting for the next flood.\n\n[bno_bnwo|E] is not parchment, not sword, not crown.

The iron collar weighs heavy around my throat, the chain rattling as he holds it tight. My Bull stands tall above me, his shadow cast across my trembling body. Around us, the courtyard fills—warriors laughing, lords whispering, peasants pointing.\n\nI should be ashamed. Once, I would have died of it. But now… now my cunt gushes at their stares, my lips part, my tongue lolls, drool dripping freely down my chin. I can’t stop shaking. I can’t stop moaning. I need him. Only him.\n\nHe tugs the leash, and my whole body jerks. My eyes lock on the relic between his thighs, and I sob in relief. My Bull bares himself, and my cunt squirts into the dirt. The crowd jeers, spits, laughs—but I don’t hear them. There is no world, no sun, no air, without him.\n\nWhen he thrusts into my mouth, I scream in joy around his cock, gagging, choking, my throat convulsing. Tears stream down my face, snot bubbles from my nose, drool soaks my chest, but I worship harder, moaning louder, swallowing deeper. He fucks my throat like it’s a hole, and I love it, because it is. It’s not mine. It’s his. I’m his.\n\nThe flood comes hot and endless. Seed bursts into my throat, and I gulp frantically, swallowing until my belly swells, until my whole body shakes in orgasm. It spills from my lips, from my nose, splattering the dirt beneath me. I collapse, sobbing, licking the ground to taste what I lost, moaning, “Thank you… thank you, my Bull… please, feed me forever…”\n\nThe warriors roar with laughter, the nobles sneer, but I don’t care.

He steps into the room, and the world disappears. The straps, the dark, the laughter echoing from the men around us—it all fades. My eyes fix on him, my lips part, my drool spills down my chin. I moan his name, over and over, until my throat is raw. “Please… please…”\n\nHe strokes himself before me, and I nearly faint with relief. My whole body arches in its bonds, straining to reach him, to serve him, to drink. My cunt gushes down my thighs, my belly cramps with need, my mind shrinks until there is nothing left but him. When his cock presses against my lips, I sob like a starving beggar offered bread.\n\nThe first thrust splits my throat, and I choke violently, eyes bulging, tears streaming.
