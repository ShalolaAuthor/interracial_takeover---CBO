Over the years, you've watched her transform from a babbling, tender child into a young woman blooming like a lotus in the first blush of spring.\n\n“My lord, did you need me for something?” [child.GetFirstName]'s crisp, melodious voice pulls you back from your reverie.\n\nShe turns, her robe fluttering lightly with the motion. Sunlight streams through the lattice window, casting a glow on her face, illuminating a flush as fresh as the dawn. Her eyes curve into crescent moons, carrying a hint of the shy anticipation unique to a maiden.\n\nAs you observe her increasingly refined and elegant demeanor, a complex emotion ripples through your heart. As her guardian, you know all too well that soon this young lady will step into the halls of marriage, becoming another man's wife.Yet, in these final moments before she comes of age and parts ways with you,a thought creeps in like a warm ray of spring sunlight, both comforting and unsettlingly provocative: “Should I seize this last chance, before she leaves, to let her taste the exquisite allure of the [bno_bbc|E]?” The notion stirs your heart, a restless heat flickering within—[child.GetFirstName], should she become part of [bno_bnwo|E]?"

bno_curious.1101.desc: "You look at this lovely girl, who has finally come of age and also needs you to give her one last lesson. As her guardian, it is your responsibility to make her understand that in this world, white women have their place.\n\n You take her away from the castle and head towards the rundown refugee camp. The night breeze brings the smell of rotting food and feces, and distant flickering weak firelight. You know that this is where she needs to learn.\n\n "Look, this is a world you don't know," you whisper to her, "You clearly don't adapt here now, but you will understand, [child.GetFirstName], you will belong here.\n\n"After circling around the refugee camp, a strong black man catches your attention. He has a heavy odor, his muscles are knotted, and his eyes are filled with wild desire. You gesture for him to come closer and gently lift the rag tied around his waist. His thick erect penis is revealed, and the veins around it reveal a ferocious look, like a beast about to pounce—literally about to devour you.\n\n[child.GetFirstName] watches this intimidating giant, her lips slightly open, seemingly unable to accept this mind-shattering intrusion into her world, shattering her long-held beliefs.\n\nAs you lick the chocolate greedily and obsessively, her eyes gradually become hazy. You can feel she is thinking, awakening. This is the effect you desire—let her understand that this is the power of black men and this is where white women belong.\n\nYou engage in fierce intercourse with that black man, feeling his brutal strength, his oversized penis entering and exiting your body. The wild thrusts send you to orgasm multiple times. Finally, you feel his release inside you, a primitive and savage pleasure. [child.GetFirstName] watches this vivid lesson with obsessed eyes, and from her enraptured gaze, you see rising desire—an awakening desire."

bno_curious.1201.desc: "You summoned [target1.GetFirstName], a perfect fit for the black teenager you wanted. His strong and muscular build provides immediate security, but what excites you most is his infant-fist-sized penis, which swings with each step he takes under the moonlight, emitting an unnatural gleam. You can sense his imminent ejaculation, a primal force, and this is exactly what you aim to teach [child.GetFirstName].\n\nShortly after, [child.GetFirstName] knocks on your dorm room door as instructed. "Come in,[child.GetFirstName]." you say.\n\nAs [child.GetFirstName] enters the room, you gesture for [target1.GetFirstName] to close the door. He stands tall with his intimidating erection, circling around [child.GetFirstName] and shutting the door behind him, as if confining her within the room. You can feel [child.GetFirstName]'s obvious tension and fear at this unexpected scene, but this is the perfect moment—through observation and experience, she will learn submission and pleasure.\n\n"Watch closely," you say, holding [child.GetFirstName] in your arms on the bed while whispering softly in her ear. You arch your plump buttocks upward, signaling the boy to enter your body with his massive instrument. The intense shock brings a surge of his raw strength, this untamed wildness that drives your obsession. Filled completely by his gigantic penis, ground against your g-spot—it's an indescribable pleasure. You hear his rough panting and feel the burning desire through his relentless thrusts, just as you see reflected in [child.GetFirstName]'s eyes. Her breathing becomes rapid; her gaze fills with desire, her writhing legs betraying the emptiness of her pussy, eagerly awaiting a cock to fill it.\n\nClearly, you've delivered a meaningful practical lesson and set an example. Now, it's her turn—[target1.GetFirstName]'s erection quivers forcefully within you, ejaculating several thick ropes of semen into your body before stirring your womb with vigorous movements. Perhaps in ten months, another future black king will be born from here.\n\nBut now, your primary focus is on educating a future queen of spades. You gently pat [child.GetFirstName]'s flushed cheek to bring her back to reality from this unprecedented orgy: "Go, [child.GetFirstName]. It's your turn now. Soon you'll understand everything I've done is for your own good, my child. Submitting to the new black order is our only choice."\n\nShy and blushing, [child.GetFirstName] slowly spreads her long legs, exposing her tender and charming intimate area to [target1.GetFirstName]'s [bno_bbc|E].

bno_curious.1301.desc: ""Come here, my child." You take [child.GetFirstName]'s delicate hand and place it on your increasingly prominent erection. Her eyes reflect a mix of confusion and desire. It's time for her to understand the position of white girls, to recognize the hidden longing within herself, and to realize that her sole pursuit should be submission to black power!\n\nGently, you kiss her and begin to undress her. You can feel her fear and unease, but her weak resistance is powerless against this true masculinity. Now is the perfect moment—perhaps she still has hesitation and fears the unknown, but you will assure her there's no need to fear.\n\n"Child, trust yourself in me; I will give you unparalleled pleasure," you say as you take advantage of her distraction, thrusting your hips forward and plunging your massive erection into her body. You roughly stretch her tight pussy before rhythmically pounding against her g-spot.\n\nYou feel her body gradually adapt to this forceful rhythm, hear her cries of pain turn into pleasured gasps, and watch as desire rises in her eyes. This is the desired effect—you break through the world she's built over sixteen years with your crude actions, stamping the power of [bno_bbc|E] deeply upon her, shattering her expectations of white men with intense orgasms. You want her to remember this moment, to understand her place—submit to [bno_bbc|E], my dear child, my [child.GetFirstName]."
