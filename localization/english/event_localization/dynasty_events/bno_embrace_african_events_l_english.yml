bno_embrace_african_1.0001.title: "A Leader's Dilemma: Siding With The People Or Powerful Immigrants?"
bno_embrace_african_1.0001.desc: "Recently there has been an influx of black immigrants from Africa coming through our borders looking for a better life. They're strong, capable workers with unique skills that could benefit the community...but some of my white subjects don't trust them and are afraid they'll take away jobs or resources from locals.\n\nAs the leader, I have to choose whether to side with my people - who make up most of the tax base but lack strength in numbers - or the new immigrants, who can help boost productivity but might cause unrest among the existing populace.\n\nIf I were to side with the locals, they would be happy and continue paying their taxes without protest. However, this means less control over the area since there would still be tension between groups, likely leading to more conflicts in the future.\n\nOn the other hand, if I chose to support the [bno_bbc|E] immigrants, they could provide valuable labor while also increasing my power base thanks to their strength and unity. But by doing so, it's likely that some white citizens would stop paying taxes out of protest or even leave entirely."

bno_embrace_african_1.0002.title: "A Bold Request"
bno_embrace_african_1.0002.desc: "A tall, muscular black man named [bbc.GetFirstName] approaches me one morning with an urgent request. He demands that I give him the position of Marshal - essentially making him the leader of our army and in charge of all military matters. His reasoning? That he can do a better job at commanding and strengthening our troops than any white guy could ever hope to.\n\nTo be honest, part of me wants to laugh at his audacity. Who does this man think he is, demanding such an important role so brazenly?\n\nBut then again...there's something about him that catches my attention. He has a presence - a confidence and strength that I can't deny. And deep down, I know that he probably could do a great job leading our army. After all, black men are known for their physical prowess and fighting skills."
bno_embrace_african_1.0002.a: "We do need someone stronger."

bno_embrace_african_1.0003.desc: "A tall, muscular black man named [bbc.GetFirstName] approaches me one morning with an unusual request. He demands that I send my white girl courtier - who is known for being a black cock addict - over to him so he can use her for the day as he pleases. His reasoning? That it would boost his ego and make him even more respected among the other immigrants...and in turn, increase our prestige and control over the county.\n\nI have to admit, this request catches me off guard at first. I mean, sure, she's a willing participant who gets off on being used like a piece of meat by big black men...but still! It feels so demeaning to even be asked such a thing!\n\nBut then again, there is something alluring about the idea of having one of my most trusted advisors be completely dominated and submissive to another man. Plus, it could potentially help solidify our position here if we show that we're willing to do whatever it takes to keep everyone happy."

[whore.GetFirstName] paced before the rough-hewn table, her silken gown pooling like scarlet water around her ankles as she muttered curses beneath her breath. The man sat opposite, a mountain of muscle draped in furs, his face still half-shadowed by the wide brimmed hat pulled low over his brow. He'd arrived on horseback a fortnight past, bearing gifts and promises of increased dominion - for one price.  A "pure" virgin maiden from my court, to be claimed as his own.  His terms were simple: surrender this girl, or pay in gold. The choice was mine, he'd said with that unnerving quiet smile, the kind that didn't quite reach the hard, hawk-like eyes."

bno_embrace_african_1.0005.desc: "The afternoon sun beat down on my back as I rode along the familiar path bordering my lands. It was a rare moment of peace before the harvest moon arrived, bringing with it an influx of nobles clamoring for audience.  I'd even indulged in the luxury of wearing silks instead of my usual rough wool habit - emerald green that mirrored the rolling hills ahead. A hawk soared overhead, a lone speck against the vast canvas of the sky. Just then, a guttural voice shattered the silence like thunder on a still day.\n\n“Hold your horse there, [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord] [ROOT.Char.GetFirstName]!”\n\nHe was a wall of muscle draped in furs, emerging from the tangled thicket flanking the path. Even at this distance, his bronze skin glistened with sweat, and a crown of tight braids bristled atop his head. A broadsword strapped to his back hinted at more than mere brawn. The man stopped short of my horse, eyes burning like hot coals in the afternoon sun. “I challenge you to a duel,” he boomed, voice resonating across the field.\n\nHe spoke with a clipped cadence I recognized as from the northern marches, yet his words held a strange authority. "Should you prevail," he continued, leaning forward, "I depart these lands, and your victory will be sung in every hall for a generation." His gaze swept over me, lingering on my silks like a hungry beast considering prey.  "But should I best you..." He smirked then, revealing teeth that were far too long for civilized men, "...you shall welcome me into your court as an equal."  An unwelcome guest with his dark eyes and broad frame already filling the space beside me."

bno_embrace_african_1.0006.desc: "A hulking figure stood framed in the doorway, dripping rainwater from the thick fur cloak he wore despite the stifling heat within.  He strode forward, eyes hard as flint and lips drawn tight over teeth like chipped ivory. Even before he spoke, his presence filled the chamber - a stark wave of earthy musk and raw power that seemed to push aside the polished scent of beeswax and lavender oil that usually clung to my court. "There is not enough," he stated simply, his voice rough as gravel scraped across stone. "Not enough…of us." He swept his gaze over the assembled lords and ladies with an almost predatory air -  myself included. It was then I realized it wasn't a complaint about lack of chairs or ale that hung in the air. His eyes lingered on me, and only briefly shifted away from my embroidered cloak to the tapestry depicting my ancestors emblazoned behind me. “There is not enough Black Blood in this court,” he declared,  his voice booming out with a quiet menace that seemed to chill the very marrow. "And if this does not change, you will have riots to deal with.""

bno_embrace_african_2.0001.desc: "The tapestries along the corridor shivered as if disturbed by a passing draft, though the air hung thick and still within my hall. I was inspecting a newly-arrived shipment of silks from across the Narrow Sea - fabrics so rich they practically pulsed with light in the dim lamplight. One particularly fine bolt, woven with threads spun from moonbeams themselves, caught my eye. It was then that the door to my private chambers burst open with such force it splintered one of the carved oak panels on its frame.\n\nA giant stood silhouetted against the flickering torchlight spilling out onto the landing. He filled the doorway like a storm cloud - broad-shouldered and corded with muscle, his face framed by a shock of tightly coiled black hair that seemed to vibrate with contained rage. Even through the coarse wool tunic he wore, the heat of his presence scorched the air around him. "Gold," he rumbled, his voice like gravel scraped across bone. He took a single step forward, and I saw the thick braids hanging from his lower lip - plaited with feathers that spoke of some forgotten tribal custom.  "Enough gold to buy peace for your villages." His eyes, two chips of obsidian in the gloom, settled on me, cold and assessing. "And enough to silence their fury before they come to claim it themselves." He gestured vaguely towards the outside world, his hand a massive fist that could easily crush an apple whole.  "My people are restless. They see what you hoard - the silks, the spices, the plump fields of wheat.” A hint of something like contempt twisted his lips as he swept his gaze across my workshop cluttered with bolts of vibrant cloth and overflowing chests of exotic treasures. "And they hunger for their share.""

bno_embrace_african_2.1001.desc: "The whispers followed me like shadows through the tapestries of my own hall - "whore", "pawn", "trumpeted her flesh" -  each sibilant syllable a prickle on my skin. My ladies-in-waiting averted their eyes, though I could feel their gazes lingering on the embroidered silks that clung to my hips, the crimson stain blooming at the centre of my bodice. It was a sacrifice - not just offering my body, but my name, my very selfhood - to appease these men with their storm-shadowed faces and voices like grinding stones. But I'd seen what happened when other lords balked at their demands. Fields set aflame, barns shattered like brittle eggshells, women dragged from homes by fists thick as pythons.  And so here I stood, poised on the precipice of a bargain struck in sweat and silk, praying that my flesh would be enough to hold back the tide before it swallowed everything whole."

bno_embrace_african_2.2001.desc: "The girl lay on the plush rug, limbs splayed like a broken doll, a soft sigh escaping her parted lips as if she were chasing some lingering dream. Moonlight spilled through the window, catching in the sweat slicking her pale skin and highlighting the dark blossoming of bruises blooming on her collarbone, just above the swell of her still-pulsating breast. I ran a thick finger through the tangled mess of blonde hair plastered to her forehead, savouring the faint musk of her mingled with our own.  Her cries had been sweet at first - surprised gasps edged with something else entirely...a kind of desperate acceptance, maybe even delight - as one after another of my men claimed her. All night they'd come and gone, each leaving their mark on that delicate flesh like signatures on parchment. Now the storm had passed, leaving behind only this quiet aftermath of tangled limbs and spent bodies. My own cock throbbed with a dull ache, still slick with her juices and theirs.  I let out a rumbling chuckle deep in my chest. Yes, peace had its price - but sometimes, it was a damn delightful one."

"Lord," he boomed, his voice grating gravel on stone, "we are tired, our women weary, and our bodies ache for release. Send us one of your white flower girls - plump, ripe, ready to be touched by strong hands." He gestured dismissively at the men flanking him, each a hulking silhouette cast in shadow behind him, all of them with eyes that simmered like coals in their skulls. "Send her before sundown or we lay down our tools.  Work ceases. Harvest will rot." My fingers tightened around the ivory hilt of my dagger. He dared to make a bargain out of simple lust?

The last thing I remember is stepping into their camp,  a tapestry of lean-tos strung between gnarled trees thick with jasmine and wood smoke. Now the air buzzes with something else: heat, urgency, the scent of countless unwashed bodies pressed close together. One hulking form had just withdrawn, his groan reverberating in my chest even as another rammed into me, a slick length of ebony driving deep within my aching cunt. No time to catch my breath, no time for anything but the frantic thrumming of blood and the way each thrust echoes through my very being. I'd thought myself prepared for this...for them…but nothing could have truly prepped me for the sheer, relentless force of it.  My mouth worked uselessly against his bristling beard as he slammed into me, burying himself deep. My legs wouldn't hold me up; they kept giving way beneath him, forcing me to sprawl further, wider. When I finally choked out a plea - "My cunt burns," I whispered through gritted teeth - the man on top merely chuckled, rough and guttural as a boar's grunt.  "Then we'll take the other end." A pair of calloused hands gripped my hips, dragging me further back until they were both hovering above me.

My voice boomed through the packed court, each syllable a hammer blow on the silence that had fallen over them after my proclamation: "Take your fill of my women tonight."  I let the murmur ripple through their ranks for a heartbeat, savoring the tension before I drove home my point. "But come the dawn," I continued, letting the firelight dance in my obsidian eyes, "only three of you will be deemed worthy. Three strong arms to work by my side, tending fields and forge alike." A low growl rumbled through them, a sound both primal and respectful; they knew what was at stake. They yearned for more than just sweat-slicked skin and the taste of ripe flesh - they craved this chance at service, at proving themselves worthy of proximity to their lord. Let the women be trophies tonight, then. Let their pleasure fuel their ambition. Come morning, only those who have left their mark deepest will stand tall."

"My [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord]," he began, voice a rumbling bass that seemed to shake the very hearthstones, "The Great Chiefs have decreed." A prickle of unease crawled down my spine as I tilted my chin higher. "They seek your daughter for one of their own in marriage. She is at age now, ripe and fair—" He paused, letting the compliment hang heavy in the air —“and a union with her would bring prosperity to this land.”  His words weren't veiled threats; they were sharpened spears aimed straight at my heart. "They offer support in exchange," he continued, unflinching as I met his gaze, "But..." The unspoken hung between us, thick and suffocating like the musk of damp earth after a spring storm.  "But?" My voice was barely a thread of silk.  He didn't hesitate. “Should you refuse,” he murmured, voice dropping to a husky growl, “your nation shall wither. Crops will fail, trade cease. The very ground beneath your feet will turn barren.” I held his gaze for another long moment, the weight of his words pressing down on me. My daughter, my [whore.GetFirstName] - so vibrant, so full of life - offered as a pawn in this game of power? A shudder ran through me, not entirely from fear. The promise of prosperity was alluring, seductive. Yet, could I bear to see her lost, swallowed whole by that foreign culture, their customs and desires strangling the light within her?"

Her warm scent, a heady blend of honeyed musk and something distinctly feminine, filled his nostrils as she lowered herself so his face was inches from her.

He knelt so deeply before you that only his chin cleared the floorboards, forehead pressed firmly against the cold stone tiles. His breath hitched in what you could only assume was nervous anticipation as he raised his head, eyes brimming with fervent adoration. "Your Majesty," he rasped, voice thick with an unspoken urgency, "Forgive my intrusion at this hour."\n\n"Rise, Father [wanderer.GetFirstName]," you said curtly, your gaze sweeping over the man's impressive physique and the way his robes clung to his broad shoulders like a second skin.

He stopped before you, hands clasped together as if offering up a sacred vessel. "The Church of the Black Cock beseeches your favor," he began, his voice low and resonant.  "It is time to begin construction upon our Cathedral: a monument to the Sovereign's Seed, a testament to His potency." He leaned forward then, the faint scent of musk mingling with frankincense clinging to him like a prayer. "The first step requires not just faith, but material offering - a not insignificant sum of your coffers." His gaze flickered to your lips, then back to meet yours, unwavering in its intensity. "But your Majesty," he continued, his voice dropping to a silken murmur, "it is said that the blessings bestowed upon those who nourish the Cathedral are... particularly bountiful.”"

The faint scent of lilac clung to her like a prayer, weaving through the incense smoke that perpetually hung in the air. It was unsettling how vividly you could picture her naked beneath those silks, how easily your mind filled the void between the folds with pale skin and delicate curves. She knelt before you, chin tucked into the elegant curve of her collarbone, hands clasped tightly together against the golden clasp of her cassock.\n\n"Your Majesty," she breathed, voice hushed yet carrying a tremor that seemed to emanate not from piety but desire.  "The first stone is laid; the foundation stands strong."  She unfurled before you then, rising with slow deliberation as if each movement was meant to be savored. "But the rest..." She trailed off, allowing her gaze to wander over your form, lingering on the way the gown clung to your hips, tracing a fingertip along the curve of your cheekbone in the air between you. "The Cathedral requires…a considerable expenditure."

His skin glowed obsidian beneath the flickering torchlight, each rise and fall of his chest a testament to a physique that spoke of both devotion and appetites far deeper than any holy text could express. You found yourself momentarily distracted as you scanned those muscled limbs before he finally lifted his head, eyes dark and gleaming like polished onyx against your dais.\n\n“Your Majesty,” he rasped, voice deep as temple drums. "The first stone of the Cathedral has been laid; a foundation strong enough to bear the weight of the Sovereign's glory." He paused, meeting your gaze with an intensity that felt more physical than spiritual. “But the rest...the edifice itself..." His fingers flexed on the jeweled clasp of his cassock, drawing attention to the hard line of his forearm and the way those broad hands might handle a woman with equal fervor as they held a holy relic. "The remaining construction requires...a substantial offering." He swallowed, eyes flicking down to your lips before returning to meet your gaze once more.  "But know this, Your Majesty," he pressed, leaning forward so his voice was barely a breath against the silken cushions of your throne, "the Cathedral's completion promises blessings beyond any earthly treasure.
