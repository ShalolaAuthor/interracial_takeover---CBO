bno_seduce_rejection.0001.title.01: "The White Man’s Offer"
bno_seduce_rejection.0001.desc.01: "[owner.GetFirstName] comes trembling before you, his face flushed, cock bulging weakly beneath his tunic. With shaking hands he empties a velvet pouch across the table—pearls scatter, gold rings tumble, jeweled brooches catch the torchlight. “All of this,” he stammers, breath hitching, “if you’ll let me fuck you.” His eyes are glued to your tits, his tongue flicking over his lips like a starving dog. The jewels gleam, but they are nothing compared to the memory burning in your holes: Bulls splitting your pussy wide, thick shafts ramming until your screams echoed, hot cum pumped deep until you dripped down your thighs. And now [owner.GetFirstName] thinks his shiny baubles can buy what only Black cock deserves.\n\nHe fidgets, shifting his tunic to hide the outline of his pathetic little dick. You smirk at the sight—your body has been marked by Black cock, transformed forever, ruined for worms like him. You’ve knelt with a Bull’s fat cock down your throat, gagging until your mascara ran; you’ve ridden until your cunt gushed around a shaft too thick to close your legs after. Compared to that, [owner.GetFirstName] stands here with nothing but trembling hands, pale jewels, and a cock that could never even touch your walls. The hall watches in silence, waiting to see if you’ll debase yourself or spit his offer back in his face."
bno_seduce_rejection.0001.a.01: "Fine… I’ll let [owner.GetFirstName] have me."
bno_seduce_rejection.0001.b.01: "Pathetic. Only Black cock fucks this pussy."

bno_seduce_rejection.0001.title.02: "The Drunken Whisper"
bno_seduce_rejection.0001.desc.02: "[owner.GetFirstName] corners you in the hallway after a feast, his breath thick with wine, eyes glazed with need. He stumbles closer, cock already stiff under his robes, and slurs that he’s dreamed of your body since the first time he saw you kneel for a Bull. His hand brushes your hip, trembling as he begs for just one night, promising that his touch will be gentle, that his cock will be enough.\n\nYour stomach twists at the thought. You remember the way Bulls bent you over, your cunt stretched open by girth so thick it made you sob with pleasure. You remember being filled until your belly ached, bred until cum ran down your legs. Compared to that, [owner.GetFirstName] reeks of weakness: his cock small, his voice whining, his need pathetic. He clings to you with pale hands, trying to lure you back to what you’ve already outgrown forever.\n\nThe corridor is silent but for his ragged breath. He doesn’t see your sneer—he only sees the chance to crawl inside a pussy already claimed by Black cock, desperate to pretend he still matters."

bno_seduce_rejection.0001.desc.03: "Moonlight spills over the garden when [owner.GetFirstName] slinks toward me. He reeks of nerves, his hands twisting, cock bulging weakly beneath his robes as his eyes devour me. “You’re beautiful,” he whispers, voice cracking. “No woman shines like you, no man deserves you more than me.” His pale hand reaches for mine, trembling as he tries to play the lover.\n\nI almost laugh. Beauty? Bulls don’t flatter me—they grab my hips and shove their fat cocks inside me until I scream. They don’t waste words when they can flood my cunt with hot cum. [owner.GetFirstName]’s pale face and soft little cock are nothing beside that. His compliments brush against me like feathers, while my pussy still throbs from being split by Bulls thick enough to tear me open.\n\nI watch him stammer, his eyes pleading, his cock twitching as if he still has a chance. He doesn’t understand: this body is Black-owned. His words mean nothing. His cock means less."
bno_seduce_rejection.0001.a.03: "…maybe just once, I’ll let [owner.GetFirstName] try me."
bno_seduce_rejection.0001.b.03: "Your flattery is worthless—only Black cock fills this pussy."

bno_seduce_rejection.0001.title.04: "Pale Hands in My Bed"
bno_seduce_rejection.0001.desc.04: "The door creaks, pulling me from sleep. At first I think it’s another Bull returning to claim me, but then I see him—[owner.GetFirstName]. Pale, trembling, his eyes shining with desperation, his cock already straining pathetically against his breeches. He stumbles closer, his breath ragged, whispering in the dark: “Better to be mocked than never to touch you.” His words make my lips curl into a sneer.\n\nThe air is thick with the scent of Bull seed, still drying on my thighs, soaking into the sheets. My body aches from the use I had earlier, holes stretched wide by cocks that left me shaking. And here he stands, this little worm, thinking his pale meat could matter, that his nervous hand could give me anything but disgust. His voice quivers, his hand hovers near my leg, and yet his eyes burn with pathetic hope—as if my body might still have a place for a cock as weak as his.\n\nPart of me wants to laugh and shove him back into the corridor, let the guards see him for the sneaking worm he is. But another part remembers—before the Bulls claimed me, before my pussy was split wide—I might have let a man like him climb into my bed. Tonight, I decide. Do I indulge his pathetic attempt for one moment of pity? Or do I spit in his face and call a Bull to show him what a real man does with me?"
bno_seduce_rejection.0001.a.04: "Fine, [owner.GetFirstName]… touch me once. See how useless your cock feels in me."
bno_seduce_rejection.0001.b.04: "Pathetic. This pussy is Black-owned—you’ll never touch it."

bno_seduce_rejection.0001.title.05: "Pale Verses, Blacked Holes"
bno_seduce_rejection.0001.desc.05: "The courtyard is silver with moonlight when [owner.GetFirstName] shuffles toward me, parchment clutched in his sweaty hands, his cock already tenting weakly under his robes. He clears his throat, voice cracking as he begins to read. “Your hair is spun gold… your lips are red as roses… no man could love you more than I.” The words pour out like spilled wine, clumsy and pale, his eyes darting to my tits, my thighs, my lips with every line. His cock twitches as though his rhymes could make me wet, as though poetry could matter to a slut already split open by Bulls.\n\nI cross my arms, listening, smirking, while my body still throbs with the memory of last night’s use. My pussy is sore, gaped wide from the Bull who bent me over and shoved his cock into me until I screamed for mercy. Cum still clings to my holes, dried on my skin, proof that I’m a whore for Black cock alone. And here’s [owner.GetFirstName], pathetic little worm, trembling while he begs with words. My cunt doesn’t ache for verses—it aches for the thick cocks that stretch me raw, for balls that slap against me until I’m dripping with seed.\n\nHe lowers the parchment, his pale face flushed, eyes wide with hope. His cock is leaking already, dampening his breeches just from saying my name. I almost laugh. He thinks this pathetic display will make me open my legs for him? That his pale cock will ever touch me the way Bulls do? I tilt my head, step closer, let him catch the scent of cum still lingering on my skin. His breath hitches, his cock jerks like a boy’s. He’s desperate, trembling, pathetic.\n\nNow I decide. Do I let him try—let him slip his cock inside me and discover how useless he really is? Or do I laugh in his face, tear his verses apart, and remind him that my pussy, my ass, my throat—all of me—belongs to Black cock alone?"
bno_seduce_rejection.0001.a.05: "…Fine, [owner.GetFirstName]. Slide your cock in and see how worthless it feels."

She laughs with her friends, hips swaying, the memory of Bulls still dripping from her body. Your cock twitches, small and eager, knowing she’s tasted better, thicker, stronger. How could she ever want you, after them? And yet you burn for her—you’ll try anything to get inside her, even once.\n\nYour heart hammers as you imagine slipping into her chambers, or pressing a gift into her hand, or just grabbing her waist when she’s drunk.

You drop the last of your pearls at her feet, scrambling to pull yourself out, your little white dick already dribbling before it even touches her. She doesn’t kiss you, doesn’t even undress—[target.GetFirstName] just bends over, cunt wet and yawning, a hole stretched wide by Bulls that bred her raw.\n\nYou shove in with a whimper, but it’s nothing. Loose, gaping, your cock sliding like a child’s toy in a well-used slit. [target.GetFirstName] moans, but you know it isn’t for you—it’s the memory of fat Black shafts pounding her into the mattress, balls slapping her ass while she screamed for more. You thrust fast, desperate, praying to make her feel something, but all you hear is her low laugh under her breath.\n\nWhen you cum, it’s weak, a pathetic spurt that barely paints her folds. She straightens before you’re even done twitching, scooping up your gold with a smirk. “Pathetic, [owner.GetFirstName],” she mutters, already reaching for her clothes. You know she’ll be on her knees for Bulls again before the hour is gone, their cum blasting yours out like it never existed. And still—you’d pay it all again just to taste her once more."

Her tits spill from her dress, her thighs glisten in the torchlight, and you can’t hold back. You lean close, whispering promises of secrecy, of gentleness, of how much you’ve always wanted her. Your cock stiffens in your breeches, pathetic compared to the Bulls she moans for nightly. Still, she hesitates, eyes clouded with drink, and then she nods.\n\nYour heart pounds as you drag her into the shadows, fumbling at your laces. You shove your cock into her pussy, and the truth hits like a lash—she’s loose, ruined, stretched by Black cocks so fat your white dick feels like nothing inside her. You groan, trying to thrust harder, but her moans aren’t for you. Every sound she makes is for the Bulls in her memory, the ones who split her open, filled her, bred her. You’re just a pale distraction, a toy sliding in a hole that was made for them.\n\nYou cum too fast, spilling weakly while she stares past you, lips parted, already aching for real cock. You pant against her neck, trembling with the thrill of having her at all, but knowing in your gut that [target.GetFirstName] will never remember your touch—only the Bulls who made her theirs."

My heart races, my cock stiff in my breeches as I whisper, “You’re beautiful… no man could ever love you like I do.” For a heartbeat I think she’ll laugh. Instead, she nods, and my cock jerks with desperate hope.\n\nI fumble at my laces, my pale dick already leaking, and push into her. At last, I’m inside—but it feels wrong. She’s loose, stretched, yawning around me. My cock slides in too easily, like it doesn’t even touch her. She moans, but her eyes are far away. I know she isn’t moaning for me. She’s remembering the Bulls who split her open, who filled her until she screamed. My thrusts are shallow, pathetic, nothing beside theirs.I cum fast, spilling weakly while she barely reacts. She straightens before I’m even soft, adjusting her gown, her eyes already drifting back toward the hall where the Bulls laugh and wait.

My cock jerks in my breeches as I scramble closer, my hands fumbling at the laces. I can’t believe it—after all the whispers, after all the nights imagining her being split by Bulls, she’s letting me have her.\n\nI push between her legs, my cock stiff but small, and slide inside. At first I gasp at the heat, the wetness—but then I feel it: nothing. She’s loose, ruined, stretched far beyond what I could ever fill. My cock slips in like it doesn’t even exist, her pussy yawning around me. She doesn’t moan for me. She stares past me, her lips parted, lost in the memory of Bulls who bent her over and stuffed her full.\n\nI thrust faster, desperate, pathetic, my balls slapping weakly against her while I whimper in her ear. She doesn’t even look at me. I cum too fast, spilling a thin spurt inside her, knowing it means nothing. My chest heaves, sweat dripping, but she just laughs under her breath, pushing me off her. “Pathetic, [owner.GetFirstName],” she sneers, already reaching for the sheets to wipe me away.

My cock is a splinter in a canyon, pathetic, useless. I see her smirk through her half-lidded eyes, the cruel twitch of her lips as I whine like a dog in her ear. My balls tighten too fast.

bno_seduce_rejection.2002.desc.05: "I stand there with my parchment in hand, cock trembling in my breeches, as I pour out the lines I wrote. “Your hair is spun gold… your lips red as roses… no man could love you more.” My voice shakes, my chest burns, my cock leaks through my tunic, but I force the words out. When I lower the parchment, [target.GetFirstName] smirks. For a heartbeat I think maybe—maybe she heard me.\n\nThen she laughs. Cruel, cutting. She rips the parchment in half, tossing it at my feet. “Pathetic. Your poems are as useless as your cock. This pussy belongs to Bulls.” My stomach twists, my cock wilts, shame flooding me—just as he appears. A Bull strides out of the shadows, huge, cock already swinging heavy between his legs.\n\nShe doesn’t even look at me again. She bends over the garden bench, moaning, spreading her pussy wide for him. He rams into her with a growl, his fat cock splitting her open, her moans filling the night. I can’t breathe as I watch her tits bounce, her ass clap against his hips, her pussy gaping around him. My hand moves without thinking, stroking my limp cock, whining as my verses echo in my head—worthless, drowned out by her screams for Black cock.\n\nHe roars, filling her cunt with cum, seed spilling down her thighs. She collapses against the bench, gasping, satisfied. I spill too—pathetically—into my breeches, a thin dribble that stains my tunic while no one even notices. She glances back at me, licking Bull seed from her fingers. “Remember your poem, [owner.GetFirstName]? My pussy moaned for his cock, not your words.”"

This pussy belongs to Bulls now—only Black cock fills me, only their cum stays inside me.” His face crumples, his cock wilts, the hall buzzing with whispers as he stands there humiliated. I turn my back, my ass swaying for the Bulls who will bend me over again tonight, leaving [owner.GetFirstName] with nothing but shame and cold pearls at his feet."

bno_seduce_rejection.2001.desc.02: "[owner.GetFirstName] staggers up to me after the feast, his breath stinking of wine, cock already poking through his breeches like he thinks it matters. He leans close, voice slurred, whispering that he wants me, that he can be gentle, that he’s always dreamed of spreading me. His pale hand creeps along my hip, trembling with desperation.\n\nI laugh in his face. “Pathetic,” I spit, pushing him back. “Your little white dick isn’t worth a drop of my wetness. This pussy is Black-owned. Only Bulls fill me now—fat, heavy, stretching me open until I scream. You? You’d never even touch my walls.” His face collapses, eyes wide with shame, cock shrinking before me.\n\nThe hall stirs with whispers as I turn my back on him, swaying my hips toward the Bulls who will split me open again tonight. Let [owner.GetFirstName] drown in humiliation. Let him know he’ll never own me, never even matter. My body belongs to Black cock, and his pale little stub will never get close."

Pathetic. Words mean nothing. His cock means less.\n\nBefore I can spit another insult, a Bull steps out of the shadows, dark skin gleaming in the moonlight, cock already heavy and hanging. My pussy clenches at once. Without hesitation I turn from [owner.GetFirstName] and fall to my knees, wrapping my lips around the Bull’s thickness, moaning as he swells down my throat. Then he bends me over the stone bench, ramming into my cunt, stretching me wide, every thrust making me scream into the night.\n\nBehind us, I hear the worm whimper. I glance back—[owner.GetFirstName] is fumbling at his breeches, stroking his limp little cock, watching helplessly as a real man uses me. When the Bull roars and fills me with hot seed, I feel his pathetic climax too: a thin dribble soaking his tunic, useless, wasted, a pale stain of humiliation. I moan for the Bull, I cum for the Bull, and [owner.GetFirstName] is nothing but a spectator in the garden, leaking shame into his clothes."

I laugh in his face. “Pathetic. This pussy is Black-owned. You’ll never touch it.” His lip quivers, his cock wilts—and then the door opens.\n\nA Bull strides in, his body huge and gleaming, his cock already heavy and swinging. My heart leaps. I slide off the bed without hesitation, dropping to my knees before him. My hands wrap around his shaft, my mouth opens wide, and I swallow him to the root. My throat bulges, my eyes water, spit streams down my chin as I gag and moan. Every inch of me worships him, each choke a prayer, each gulp a hymn.\n\nHe groans, and I moan louder, sucking harder until he explodes. Hot cum floods my throat, spilling into my belly as I drink greedily, not letting a drop escape. When I finally pull back, gasping, my lips shine, my chest slick with spit and seed. Behind me I hear [owner.GetFirstName] whimpering, his hand in his breeches, cumming thinly into his own clothes as he watches me serve a real man.\n\nI laugh and lick my lips. “See, [owner.GetFirstName]?” I sneer between breaths. “This is what I was made for.

I let him finish, then I laugh—low, cruel, sharp enough to cut him to pieces. “Pathetic,” I sneer, tearing the parchment in half and tossing it to the dirt. “Your poems are worthless, just like your cock. This pussy belongs to Bulls.”\n\nAs if the gods themselves heard me, a Bull strides from the shadows, towering, his cock already heavy and hard. My pussy clenches instantly. I turn away from the worm and bend over the garden bench, spreading myself wide, moaning for the Bull to take me. He doesn’t hesitate. He rams his fat cock into my pussy, stretching me open, pounding me until my screams echo through the night. My cunt gushes around him, my body shaking as his balls slap against me.\n\nI glance back at [owner.GetFirstName]. He’s frozen, pale face burning red, his hand trembling as it strokes his limp cock. I sneer at him between moans. “Look, worm! Look at what real cock does to me!” The Bull slams deeper, splitting me until my pussy gapes, my ass bouncing with each thrust. My moans grow louder, wetter, ecstatic—every sound a hymn to Black cock, every thrust a reminder that I’m Black-owned forever.\n\nThe Bull roars, flooding me with hot cum, my pussy overflowing, dripping down my thighs. I collapse onto the bench, gasping, stuffed and satisfied. Behind me, [owner.GetFirstName] spills weakly into his own hand, a pathetic dribble staining his breeches.

She sways her hips like she owns every man in the room—and maybe she does. You’ve heard the whispers. Bulls bend her over nightly, splitting her pussy with fat Black cocks, filling her with seed until she leaks down her thighs. Still, your cock stiffens at the thought of her, desperate, pathetic, willing to believe there’s still a chance.\n\nThe pouch grows heavy in your grip. Pearls, rings, golden chains—your inheritance, your fortune, everything you own. What is it compared to the chance to slip your cock inside her, even once? You know you’ll never measure up. Your white dick will never fill her the way Bulls have. But if wealth cannot buy her, what hope do you have at all?\n\nYou breathe deep, cock twitching in your breeches, and step forward.

You know what they’ll do with her tonight—bend her over, split her open, leave her dripping with Black seed until she can’t walk straight. Your little white cock throbs painfully at the thought, pathetic but desperate, aching to be the one inside her.\n\nThe courage the wine gives you is false, but it’s all you have. You stumble through the corridor after her, cock twitching with each step, rehearsing your lines in your head. I’ll whisper to her, I’ll beg her to let me… I’ll promise secrecy, I’ll promise devotion. You know she belongs to Bulls now, her pussy ruined for white flesh, but you can’t stop yourself.

Your cock stirs uselessly beneath your tunic—she’s been blacked, stretched by cocks that could crush you, yet here you are, clutching at words instead of girth.\n\nYou lick your lips and step from the shadows. Tell her she’s beautiful, you whisper to yourself, tell her no man could love her like you do. Your heart pounds as you imagine her smile, imagine her body turning toward you. Deep down you know her pussy is owned by Bulls, ruined for men like you.

Behind it lies [target.GetFirstName]—the slut every Bull has already ruined, the pussy split open by fat Black cocks, stretched and dripping until no white man could ever fill her again. Still, my cock aches for her, desperate and pathetic, convinced that if I can just slide inside her, even once, I’ll matter.\n\nThe latch groans as I push it open, slipping into the dark. There she is. [target.GetFirstName] lies sprawled on silk sheets, her golden hair messy, her thighs bare, her lips parted in sleep. The room reeks faintly of cum—thick Bull seed still staining the air. My cock jerks painfully at the thought that she’s been used here, in this very bed, by men bigger, stronger, darker than I’ll ever be.\n\nI creep closer, my breath ragged, my hand trembling as it brushes the edge of the blanket. If she wakes, she might laugh. If I touch her, she might scream. But the thought of walking away is worse. Better to risk humiliation, better to be spat on, than to live knowing I never even tried.

My cock twitches uselessly in my breeches as I imagine [target.GetFirstName]’s smile, her hips swaying, her cunt dripping with the seed of the Bulls who’ve already ruined her.\n\nI gather my courage and find her in the courtyard, the moon painting her skin pale, her body glowing as if touched by gods. She turns when I stammer her name, her eyes glinting, lips curling in amusement. My heart pounds as I draw out the parchment and read, voice trembling, every verse spilling from me like a confession. She doesn’t interrupt—she listens, smirking, one hand idly tracing her thigh as if she knows exactly how small and desperate I feel.\n\nWhen I finish, the silence is thick. My cock is hard, my palms slick with sweat, hope burning in my chest. She tilts her head, eyes running over me, her mouth twitching between a laugh and a sneer. For a breathless moment I think my words might matter—that poetry could reach her heart, even if Bulls already own her body.\n\nBut then her smile deepens, cruel and amused. She takes a step closer, close enough for me to smell the faint musk of Bull seed still clinging to her skin. My cock jerks, my body trembles. Now I wait, helpless, for her choice: mock me or let me touch her, just once."
