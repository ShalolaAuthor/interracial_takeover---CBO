game_concept_bno_slaves: "BBC Slaves"
game_concept_bno_slave_desc: "A $game_concept_bno_slave$ is a [character|E] who has been utterly stripped of dignity and branded as property under the [bno_bnwo|E]. Enslaved by a Black master, they exist only as flesh to be used, bred, and broken. Their body, holes, and even their lineage belong fully to their owner.\n\nA $game_concept_bno_slave$ may not hold or inherit [titles|E], and any children born from a slave womb are automatically slaves themselves, bred directly into bondage. A white male or futa slave will be caged or castrated to deny them false manhood, while females are kept fertile and open for seed.\n\nIf the master dies, ownership of all $game_concept_bno_slave$ will pass to their [primary_heir|E], ensuring they remain chained across generations. A white slut cannot herself own a slave; she must have at least one BBC in her court to act as true master and enforce ownership.\n\nA $game_concept_bno_slave$ can never claim freedom by right—only through their master’s will via the $carn_free_slave_interaction$ [character_interaction|E]. Their fate is a lesson: under the [bno_bnwo|E], they are forever property, forever holes to be filled."

A $game_concept_bno_cum_slave$ cannot betray or resist her master; her very life depends on his seed. She is not merely a whore, but a vessel of [bno_bnwo|E]—proof that a pale cunt’s highest purpose is devotion to one Bull."

game_concept_bno_bulls: "Bulls"
game_concept_bno_bull_desc: "A $game_concept_bno_bull$ is not merely a [bno_bbc|E], but one who has forged a [bno_cum_slave|E]. His cock has broken her mind, his seed has enslaved her body, and her loyalty belongs to him alone. Where ordinary men sway subjects with words or wealth, a $game_concept_bno_bull$ rules with shaft and seed. His Cum Slave is living proof of [bno_bnwo|E]’s truth—that pale women exist only to be bound, addicted, and bred by their Bull. A court or army led by a $game_concept_bno_bull$ thrives, for his dominance inspires fear in men and devotion in sluts."

game_concept_bno_slave_owners: "BBC Slave Owners"

These sluts can be used, traded, or gifted at will, their wombs and labor serving as tools of conquest.\n\nUnlike a [bno_cum_slave|E], whose devotion is bound body and soul to her [bno_bull|E] alone, an ordinary $game_concept_bno_slave$ is transferable property—proof that under [bno_bnwo|E], white women are not wives or nobles, but breeding cattle for their masters."
