bno_great_replacement_effect.desc: "The land moans beneath the weight of conquest. Where pale tongues once ruled, African words now spill from every mouth. The queen’s womb and the [bno_bbc|E]’s cock have written a new order into flesh and soil alike — soldiers march to darker drums, maidens spread their thighs for stronger seed, and the county itself has been bred into submission."
bno_great_replacement_effect_cultural_acceptance: "The county writhes under forced harmony. Pale and dark tongues entwine, moans drowning out protest, until every culture bends together in worship of the [bno_bbc|E]. What was once division is now submission — a unity bred at the tip of his cock."
